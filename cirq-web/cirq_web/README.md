## Cirq Visualizations

_This directory contains the code and instructions for calling Typescript
visualization in Cirq using Python. While necessary, this is only half of the
code needed to run the `cirq-web` project. For information on how to integrate
projects here with Python and the wider Cirq package, see the `cirq_ts`
directory._

The `cirq_web` package runs separately from the rest of Cirq, and can be used
on an opt-in basis with the rest of the project.

### Module build structure

A reference for the build structure of a module is the Bloch sphere. Reference
the `bloch_sphere/` directory to see the code. Modules should:

*   Abide by Cirq convention in terms of testing, styling, and initialization
    files.

*   Contain a "root" folder labeled according to the title of the module. In
    the case of the Bloch sphere, this is `bloch_sphere/`.

*   Contain a main class that contains the code for the visualization. All
    supporting files should be imported into this class. In the case of the
    Bloch sphere, this is `bloch_sphere.py`.

*   Make sure that any additional modules and files are in separate
    subdirectories labeled accordingly.

### Developing Python modules for visualization

In order to actually get visualization output from our Python calls, we return
strings of HTML and Javascript. In order to keep things organized, we include a
parent class `Widget` (`widget.py`) which handles the configuration behind
locating and reading files so that only code specific to each visualization
lives in its main class.

The main class for all visualizations should inherit from the `Widget` class
located in this directory. Upon creating a new Widget, you should include a
call to initialize the parent like so:

```python
class MyWidget(widget.Widget):
    def __init__(self,...):
        ...
        super().__init__()
        ...
```

This ensures that your widget has the standard functionality of all Cirq
visualization widgets, including:

*   A unique id for each instance of your visualization.

*   Magic method so that your visualization can be displayed in a Colab/Jupyter
    notebook.

*   The ability to generate a standalone HTML file with your visualization.

`Widget` is an abstract class with methods `get_client_code()` and
`get_widget_bundle_name()` that need to be implemented in your visualization as
well. Failure to implement these will lead to a `NotImplementedError` at
runtime. Instructions on how to properly implement these methods are in the
next section.

### Handling HTML output from Python

In your individual visualizations class, you only need to handle two things:

 1.  The client code that's unique to your visualization.
 2.  The name of the bundle file.

```python
from cirq_web import widget

class MyWidget(widget.Widget):
    ...
    def get_client_code(self) -> str:
        return f"""
            <script>
            YOUR_CLIENT_CODE
            </script>
        """

    def get_widget_bundle_name(self) -> str:
        return 'YOUR_BUNDLE_FILE.bundle.js'
```

`Widget` will take this information and organize it so that it can be properly displayed.

#### Viewing a visualization in a notebook setting

We capitalize on IPython's `_repr_html_` magic method to help display
visualizations in the notebook. This will allow your visualization to be
displayed in a notebook cell with:

```python
widget = MyWidget()
display(widget)
```

#### Generating a standalone HTML file from a visualization

You can generate a standalone HTML file of your visualization like so:

```python
widget = MyWidget()

output_directory = './'
file_name = 'YOUR_VIZ.html'
open_in_browser = False

widget.generate_html_file(output_directory, file_name, open_in_browser)
```

This code above writes a file named `YOUR_VIZ.html` to the specified output
directory, returning the path of the file as a string. If the `open_in_browser`
flag is used, Python will automatically open your visualization in a new tab
using the default browser on your computer.

The important thing about generating standalone HTML files is that they can be
sent and viewed anywhere, regardless of whether the recipient has Cirq
installed on their computer or not.

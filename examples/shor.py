"""Demonstrates Shor's algorithm.

Shor's algorithm [1] is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. Given
a composite integer n, it finds its non-trivial factor d, i.e. a factor other
than 1 or n.

The algorithm consists of two parts: quantum order-finding subroutine and
classical probabilistic reduction of the factoring problem to the order-
finding problem. Given two positive integers x and n, the order-finding
problem asks for the smallest positive integer r such that x**r mod n == 1.

The classical reduction algorithm first handles two corner cases which do
not rely on quantum computation: when n is even or a prime power. For other
n, the algorithm first draws a random x uniformly from 2..n-1 and then uses
the quantum order-finding subroutine to compute the order r of x modulo n,
i.e. it finds the smallest positive integer r such that x**r == 1 mod n. Now,
if r is even, then y = x**(r/2) is a solution to the equation

    y**2 == 1 mod n.                                                   (*)

It's easy to see that in this case gcd(y - 1, n) or gcd(y + 1, n) divides n.
If in addition y is a non-trivial solution, i.e. if it is not equal to -1,
then gcd(y - 1, n) or gcd(y + 1, n) is a non-trivial factor of n (note that
y cannot be 1). If r is odd or if y is a trivial solution of (*), then the
algorithm is repeated for a different random x.

It turns out [1] that the probability of r being even and y = x**(r/2) being
a non-trivial solution of equation (*) is at least 1 - 1/2**(k - 1) where k
is the number of distinct prime factors of n. Since the case k = 1 has been
handled by the classical part, we have k >= 2 and the success probability of
a single attempt is at least 1/2.

The subroutine for finding the order r of a number x modulo n consists of two
steps. In the first step, Quantum Phase Estimation is applied to a unitary such
as

    U|y⟩ = |xy mod n⟩  0 <= y < n
    U|y⟩ = |y⟩         n =< y

whose eigenvalues are s/r for s = 0, 1, ..., r - 1. In the second step, the
classical continued fractions algorithm is used to recover r from s/r. Note
that when gcd(s, r) > 1 then an incorrect r is found. This can be detected
by verifying that r is indeed the order of x. If it is not, Quantum Phase
Estimation algorithm is retried.

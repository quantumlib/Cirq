"""Demonstrates the algorithm for solving linear systems by Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL).

The HHL algorithm solves a system of linear equations, specifically equations of the form Ax = b,
where A is a Hermitian matrix, b is a known vector, and x is the unknown vector. To solve on a
quantum system, b must be rescaled to have magnitude 1, and the equation becomes:

|x> = A**-1 |b> / || A**-1 |b> ||

The algorithm uses 3 sets of qubits: a single ancilla qubit, a register (to store eigenvalues of
A), and memory qubits (to store |b> and |x>). The following are performed in order:
1) Quantum phase estimation to extract eigenvalues of A
2) Controlled rotations of ancilla qubit
3) Uncomputation with inverse quantum phase estimation

For details about the algorithm, please refer to papers in the REFERENCE section below. The
following description uses variables defined in the HHL paper.

This example is an implementation of the HHL algorithm for arbitrary 2x2 Hermitian matrices. The
output of the algorithm are the expectation values of Pauli observables of |x>. Note that the
accuracy of the result depends on the following factors:
* Register size
* Choice of parameters C and t

The result is perfect if
* Each eigenvalue of the matrix is in the form

  2π/t * k/N,

  where 0≤k<N, and N=2^n, where n is the register size. In other words, k is a value that can be
  represented exactly by the register.
* C ≤ 2π/t * 1/N, the smallest eigenvalue that can be stored in the circuit.

The result is good if the register size is large enough such that for every pair of eigenvalues,
the ratio can be approximated by a pair of possible register values. Let s be the scaling factor
from possible register values to eigenvalues. One way to set t is

t = 2π/(sN)

For arbitrary matrices, because properties of their eigenvalues are typically unknown, parameters C
and t are fine-tuned based on their condition number.

"""Superdense Coding.
Superdense Coding is a method to transmit two classical bits of information
by sending only one qubit of information. This is accomplished by
pre-sharing an entangled state between the sender and the receiver. This
entangled state allows the receiver of the one qubit of information to
decode the two classical bits that were originally encoded by the sender.

In the following example output, qubit 0 and qubit 1 are randomly set to
either 0 or 1 by using Hadamard and Measure gates. By sending one qubit of
information between qubit 2 and qubit 3, the receiver is able to decode the
originally encoded information when qubits 3 and 4 are measured. This is
only possible given that an entangled state is pre-shared between the
sender and receiver.

The two input bits and the two output bits returned by this circuit should
be identical.

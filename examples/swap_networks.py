"""Demonstrates swap networks.

Swap networks are used to get around limited connectivity in a hardware device.
In this example, we'll give a concrete application by using the acquaintance
submodule to implement a single-round QAOA for Maximum Cut on a linearly
connected device even with an arbitrary problem graph.

Specifically, we'd like to implement the circuit U_mix(β) * U_phase(𝛾), where

    U_mix(β) = X**β ⊗ X**β ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ X**β,
    U_phase(𝛾) = ZZ_{e_m}**𝛾 ⋯ ZZ_{e_2}**𝛾· ZZ_{e_1}**𝛾, and
    {e_1, e_2, …, e_m} are the edges of the graph whose maximum cut we would
        like to find.

The details of QAOA are irrelevant; for our purposes here, it is sufficient to
say that we want to apply a 2-qubit gate to pairs of qubits, even when the
implied graph is not a subgraph of the hardware adjacency graph.

"""Implements direct fidelity estimation.

Fidelity between the desired pure state rho and the actual state sigma is
defined as:
F(rho, sigma) = Tr (rho sigma)

It is a unit-less measurement between 0.0 and 1.0. The following two papers
independently described a faster way to estimate its value:

Direct Fidelity Estimation from Few Pauli Measurements

Practical characterization of quantum devices without tomography
https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3835

This code implements the algorithm proposed for an example circuit (defined in
the function build_circuit()) and a noise (defines in the variable noise).

    This example shows various methods on how to characterize a qubit, including
    Clifford-based randomized benchmarking and state tomography.

    The number of cliffords to use in a randomized benchmarking experiment
    can be varied.  For instance, setting minimum_cliffords=10,
    maximum_cliffords=30 and cliffords_step=5 will test depths of 10, 15, 20,
    and 25 (the maximum of the range is exclusive).

        minimum_cliffords: the number of Clifford gates to start with in a
          randomized benchmarking study
        maximum_cliffords: the number of Clifford gates to scale up to in a
          randomized benchmarking study.  This is used as an exclusive limit.
        cliffords_step: the increment to step with from the minimum to maximum
          number of Clifford gates.

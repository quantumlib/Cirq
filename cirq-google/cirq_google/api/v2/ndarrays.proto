/*
 * Packed arrays store n-dimensional, homogeneous numeric data in a serialized
 * byte array, along with their shape and endianness. Their performance is
 * competitive with labrad and flatbuffer serialization/deserialization due to
 * the reduced scope of functionality (i.e. just arrays).
 *
 * Each packed type has:
 *  - shape: a list of integers that mimic numpy's shape parameter. That is,
 *    each element represents the length of a dimension. A 2-D n x m array would
 *    have the shape [n, m].
 *  - endianness: The endianness of encoding; client libraries are responsible
 *    for correcting mismatched endianness. We highly recommend client
 *    libraries to stick with consistent and, preferably, system-native
 *    endianness. Note that unspecified endianness defaults to little endian;
 *    this approximately reflects how protobufs are serialized on the wire.
 *
 * Note that different types are used to enforce typing in downstream data
 * data sources without inspecting the proto data.  (For instance, enforcing
 * that a field stored as a proto is Complex128 requires only checking message
 * type and not the data.)

 * BitArrays represent arbitrary shape bit arrays.

 * They are packed into bytes, in big-endian bit order and therefore will

 *
 * For example, say we have an array:
 *    array = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
 *    Where array[0] == 0, array[1] == 1, array[2] == 1, etc.
 *
 * It will get mapped into bytes as follows:
 *    0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0 : 1  0  1  0
 *   [       byte 0          |        byte 1         ]
 *    7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 : 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0     <-- bit index in byte
 *                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^
 *                                         unused bits will be zeroed out

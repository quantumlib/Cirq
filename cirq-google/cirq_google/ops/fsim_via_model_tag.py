    Without the tag, the translation of FSim gate implementation is possible only for a certain
    angles. For example, when theta=pi/2, phi=0, it translates into the same implementation
    as the SWAP gate. If FSimGate is tagged with this class, the translation will become
    a coupler gate that with proper coupler strength and coupler length via some polynomial
    modelling. Note not all combination of theta and phi in FSim gate are feasible and
    you need the calibration for these angle in advance before using them.

"""Utility functions to estimate runtime using Engine to execute circuits.

Users can call estimate_run_time, estimate_run_sweep_time, or
estimate_run_batch_time to retrieve approximations of runtime on QCS
of various sizes and shapes of circuits.

Times were extrapolated from actual runs on Sycamore processors during
November 2021.  These times should only be used as a rough guide.
Your experience may vary based on many factors not captured here.

Parameters were calculated using a variety of width/depth/sweeps from
the rep rate calculator, see:

[https://github.com/quantumlib/ReCirq/blob/master/recirq/benchmarks/rep_rate/](https://github.com/quantumlib/ReCirq/blob/master/recirq/benchmarks/rep_rate/){:.external}

Model was then fitted by hand, correcting for anomalies and outliers
when possible.

    This estimate includes tasks like electronics setup, gate compiling,
    and throughput of constant-time data.

    This time depends on the size of the circuits being compiled
    (width and depth) and also includes a factor for the number of
    times the compilation is done (sweeps).  Since sweeps save some of
    the work, this factor scales less than one.

    This is based on an approximate rep rate for "fast" circuits at about
    24k reps per second.  More qubits measured (width) primarily slows
    this down, with an additional factor for very high depth circuits.

    For multiple sweeps, there is some additional cost, since not all
    sweeps can be batched together.  Sweeping in general is more efficient,
    but it is not perfectly parallel.  Sweeping also seems to be more
    sensitive to the number of qubits measured, for reasons not understood.

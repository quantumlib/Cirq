"""Classes for running against Google's Quantum Cloud Service.

As an example, to run a circuit against the xmon simulator on the cloud,
    engine = cirq_google.Engine(project_id='my-project-id')
    program = engine.create_program(circuit)
    result0 = program.run(params=params0, repetitions=10)
    result1 = program.run(params=params1, repetitions=10)

In order to run on must have access to the Quantum Engine API. Access to this
API is (as of June 22, 2018) restricted to invitation only.

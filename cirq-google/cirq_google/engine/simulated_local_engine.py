"""Classes for running against Google's Quantum Cloud Service.

As an example, to run a circuit against the xmon simulator on the cloud,
    engine = cirq_google.Engine(project_id='my-project-id')
    program = engine.create_program(circuit)
    result0 = program.run(params=params0, repetitions=10)
    result1 = program.run(params=params1, repetitions=10)

In order to run on must have access to the Quantum Engine API. Access to this
API is (as of June 22, 2018) restricted to invitation only.

    are given during initialization.  Program and job querying

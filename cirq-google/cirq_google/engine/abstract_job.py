    """An abstract object representing a quantum job execution.

    This represents the state of a possibly asynchronous Job being
    executed by a simulator, the cloud Engine service, or other means.

    This is an abstract interface that implementers of services or mocks
    should implement.  It generally represents the execution of a circuit
    using a set of parameters called a sweep.  It can also represent the
    execution of a batch job (a list of circuit/sweep pairs) or the
    execution of a calibration request.

    This job may be in a variety of states. It may be scheduling, it may be
    executing on a machine, or it may have entered a terminal state
    (either succeeding or failing).

    `AbstractJob`s can be iterated over, returning `Result`s. These
    `Result`s can also be accessed by index. Note that this will block
    until the results are returned.

# DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY (except to fix formatting errors)
This directory and all of its sub-directories contain only generated RPC clients for the
`QuantumEngineService` and the associated request/response objects. The only edits made to the
generated code should be to fix fix formatting issues, which can be done by running the following
command from from the Cirq root:

```
./check/format-incremental --apply
```

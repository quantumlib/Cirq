This directory contains snapshots of `DeviceSpecification` proto messages
(defined in `cirq-google/cirq_google/api/v2/device.proto`) describing Google devices.

Files with the suffix `_for_grid_device` are equivalent representations of corresponding proto files
without the suffix, but in the new `DeviceSpecification` format which is parsed into
`cirq_google.GridDevice`.

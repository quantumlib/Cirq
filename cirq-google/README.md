# cirq-google

This is the Cirq-Google integration module. It provides an interface to
Google's [Quantum Computing
Service](https://quantumai.google/cirq/google/concepts), and also contains
additional tools for calibration and characterization of Google's quantum
hardware devices.

| Please note!         |
|:--------------------:|
| Google's quantum hardware is currently available only to authorized partners. Access requires an application, usually with a Google sponsor.|

[Cirq] is a Python package for writing, manipulating, and running [quantum
circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit) on quantum computers
and simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with todayâ€™s
[noisy intermediate-scale quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862) (NISQ)
computers, where the details of quantum hardware are vital to achieving
state-of-the-art results. For more information about Cirq, please visit the
[Cirq documentation site].

## Installation

This module is built on top of [Cirq]; installing this module will
automatically install `cirq-core` and other dependencies. There are two
installation options for the `cirq-google` module:

*   To install the stable version of `cirq-google`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-google
    ```

*   To install the latest pre-release version of `cirq-google`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-google~=1.0.dev
    ```

    (The `~=` has a special meaning to `pip` of selecting the latest version
    compatible with the `1.*` and `dev` in the name. Despite appearances,
    this will not install an old version 1.0 release!)

If you would like to install Cirq with all the optional modules, not just
`cirq-google`, then instead of the above commands, use `pip install cirq` for
the stable release or `pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the latest pre-release
version.

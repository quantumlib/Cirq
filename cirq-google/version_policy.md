# cirq-google Version Policy

The `cirq-google` directory should abide by Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. In rare cases, we may introduce backward-incompatible changes to the public API in a release with a minor version increment. Such changes will be noted in `CHANGELOG.md` within the directory before the release.

{ // Summary: markdownlint config file for Cirq                    -*- jsonc -*-
  //
  // Note: there are multiple programs programs named "markdownlint". For
  // Cirq, we use https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli/, which is
  // the one you get with "brew install markdownlint" on MacOS.
  //
  // These settings try to stay close to the Google Markdown Style as
  // described at https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html
  //
  // For a list of configuration options, see the following page:
  // https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md
  // (Beware that the above looks similar but is NOT the same as the page
  // https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/main/docs/RULES.md.)

  // The Google style does not define what to do about trailing punctuation in

  // Basic Markdown allows raw HTML. Both GitHub & PyPI support subsets of
  // HTML, though it's unclear what subset PyPI supports. Google's style
  // guide doesn't disallow using HTML, although it recommends against it. (C.f.
  // the bottom of https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html)
  // It's worth noting, though, that Google's guidance has Google's internal
  // documentation system in mind, and that system extends Markdown with
  // constructs that make it possible to accomplish things you can't do in
  // Markdown. Those extensions are also not available outside Google's system.
  // Thus, although a goal of this markdownlint configuration is to match
  // Google's style guide as closely as possible, these various factors suggest
  // it's reasonable to relax the HTML limitation. The list below is based on
  // https://github.com/github/markup/issues/245#issuecomment-682231577 plus
  // some things found elsewhere after that was written.

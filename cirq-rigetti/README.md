# cirq-rigetti

This is the Cirq-Rigetti integration module. It provides an interface that
allows [Cirq] quantum algorithms to run on quantum computers made by [Rigetti
Computing Inc.](https://www.rigetti.com). (See the
[Documentation](#documentation) section below for information about getting
access to Rigetti devices.)

[Cirq] is a Python package for writing, manipulating, and running [quantum
circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit) on quantum computers
and simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with todayâ€™s
[noisy intermediate-scale quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862) (NISQ)
computers, where the details of quantum hardware are vital to achieving
state-of-the-art results. For more information about Cirq, please visit the
[Cirq documentation site].

## Installation

This module is built on top of [Cirq]; installing this module will
automatically install the `cirq-core` module and other dependencies. There are
two installation options for the `cirq-rigetti` module:

*   To install the stable version of `cirq-rigetti`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-rigetti
    ```

*   To install the latest pre-release version of `cirq-rigetti`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-rigetti~=1.0.dev
    ```

    (The `~=` has a special meaning to `pip` of selecting the latest version
    compatible with the `1.*` and `dev` in the name. Despite appearances,
    this will not install an old version 1.0 release!)

If you would like to install Cirq with all the optional modules, not just
`cirq-rigetti`, then instead of the above commands, use `pip install cirq` for the
stable release or `pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the latest pre-release
version.

## Documentation

To get started with using Rigetti quantum computers through Cirq, please refer to
the following documentation:

    "## Improving circuit fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tips and tricks show how to modify your circuit to\n",
    "reduce error rates by following good circuit design principles that\n",
    "minimize the length of circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Engine will execute a circuit as faithfully as possible.\n",
    "This means that moment structure will be preserved. That is, all gates in a\n",
    "moment are guaranteed to be executed before those in any later moment and\n",
    "after gates in previous moments.  Many of these tips focus on having a\n",
    "good moment structure that avoids problematic missteps that can cause\n",
    "unwanted noise and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: See the [Circuit optimization, gate alignment, and spin echoes tutorial](/cirq/tutorials/google/spin_echoes.ipynb) for an example of the best practices discussed in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short gate depth\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) era, gates and devices still\n",
    "have significant error. Both gate errors and T1 decay rate can cause long circuits\n",
    "to have noise that overwhelms any signal in the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended gate depths vary significantly with the structure of the circuit itself\n",
    "and will likely increase as the devices improve. Total circuit fidelity can be roughly\n",
    "estimated by multiplying the fidelity for all gates in the circuit. For example,\n",
    "using a error rate of 0.5% per gate, a circuit of depth 20 and width 20 could be estimated\n",
    "at 0.995^(20 * 20) = 0.135. Using separate error rates per gates (i.e. based on calibration\n",
    "metrics) or a more complicated noise model can result in more accurate error estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that measurements are kept in the same moment as the final moment in\n",
    "the circuit.  Make sure that any circuit optimizers do not alter this by\n",
    "incorrectly pushing measurements forward. This behavior can be avoided by\n",
    "measuring all qubits with a single gate or by adding\n",
    "the measurement gate after all optimizers have run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, only terminal measurements are supported by the hardware.  If you\n",
    "absolutely need intermediate measurements for your application, reach out to\n",
    "your Google sponsor to see if they can help devise a proper circuit using\n",
    "intermediate measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep qubits busy\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits that remain idle for long periods tend to dephase and decohere. Inserting a\n",
    "[Spin Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_echo) into your circuit onto\n",
    "qubits that have long idle periods, such as a pair\n",
    "of involutions, such as two successive Pauli Y gates, will generally increase\n",
    "performance of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that this should be done after calling\n",
    "`cirq.optimize_for_target_gateset`, since this function will 'optimize'\n",
    "these operations out of the circuit. You can also tag the spin echo operations with a no-compile tag, and include these tags in `context.tags_to_ignore`, so that the transformer ignores all tagged operations marked with any of `context.tags_to_ignore`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Delay initialization of qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "The |0⟩ state is more robust than the |1⟩ state. As a result, one should\n",
    "not initialize a qubit to |1⟩ at the beginning of the circuit until shortly\n",
    "before other gates are applied to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Align single-qubit and two-qubit layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices are generally calibrated to circuits that alternate single-qubit gates with\n",
    "two-qubit gates in each layer. Staying close to this paradigm will often improve\n",
    "performance of circuits.  This will also reduce the circuit's total duration,\n",
    "since the duration of a moment is its longest gate.  Making sure that each layer\n",
    "contains similar gates of the same duration can be challenging, but it will\n",
    "likely have a measurable impact on the fidelity of your circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices generally operate in the Z basis, so that rotations around the Z axis will become\n",
    "book-keeping measures rather than physical operations on the device. These\n",
    "virtual Z operations have zero duration and have no cost, if they add no moments\n",
    "to your circuit.  In order to guarantee that they do not add moments, you can\n",
    "make sure that virtual Z are aggregated into their own layer.  Alternatively,\n",
    "you can use the `cirq.eject_z` optimizer to propagate these Z gates forward through\n",
    "commuting operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the function `cirq.stratified_circuit` for an automated way to organize gates\n",
    "into moments with similar gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qubit picking\n",
    "\n",
    "On current NISQ devices, qubits cannot be considered identical.  Different\n",
    "qubits can have vastly different performance and can vary greatly from day\n",
    "to day.  It is important for experiments to have a dynamic method to\n",
    "pick well-performing qubits that maximize the fidelity of the experiment.\n",
    "There are several techniques that can assist with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Analyze calibration metrics:  performance of readout, single-qubit, and\n",

    "calibration procedure.  These metrics can be used as a baseline to evaluate\n",
    "circuit performance or identify outliers to avoid.  This data can be inspected\n",
    "programmatically by retrieving metrics from the [API](calibration.md) or\n",
    "[visually by applying a cirq.Heatmap](/cirq/tutorials/google/visualizing_calibration_metrics.ipynb)\n",

    "data is only taken during calibration (e.g. at most daily), drifts and other\n",

    "\n",
    "### Refitting gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual Z gates (or even single qubit gates) can be added to adjust for errors\n",
    "in two qubit gates.  Two qubit gates can have errors due to drift, coherent\n",
    "error, unintended cross-talk, or other sources.  Refitting these gates and\n",
    "adjusting the circuit for the observed unitary of the two qubit gate\n",
    "compared to the ideal unitary can substantially improve results.\n",
    "However, this approach can use a substantial amount of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique involves two distinct steps.  The first is *characterization*,\n",
    "which is to identify the true behavior of the two-qubit gate.  This typically\n",
    "involves running many varied circuits involving the two qubit gate in a method\n",
    "(either periodic or random) to identify the parameters of the gate's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entangling gates used in Google's architecture fall into a general category of FSim gates,\n",
    "standing for *Fermionic simulation*.  The generalized version of this gate can\n",
    "be parameterized into 5 angles, or degrees of freedom.  Characterization will\n",
    "attempt to identify the values of these five angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is calibrating (or refitting) the gate.  Out of the five angles\n",

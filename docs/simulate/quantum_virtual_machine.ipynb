    "The quantum virtual machine is a virtual Google quantum processor that you can run circuits on by using the [virtual engine interface](./virtual_engine_interface.ipynb). Behind this interface, it uses simulation with noise data to mimic Google quantum hardware processors with high accuracy: In internal tests, the virtual and actual hardware are within experimental error of each other. Additionally, it supports internal use of the high-performance [qsim](/qsim) simulator, for fast execution of larger circuits. The QVM should be used as a preparation step before running on Google hardware, and as a substitute for Google hardware when it is not available.\n",

After doing so, skip forward to the [How to use a QVM](#how_to_use_a_qvm) section. If you're interested in how the QVM is prepared for use, continue on to the following section."

We recommend using 10,000+ repetitions for research simulations, and 3,000 repetitions for learning simulations. If you are just getting a feel for the tools you can set the number of repetitions lower temporarily (eg 1 to 10) to speed things up.\n"

Recommended for deep circuits with up to 30 qubits (consumes 8GB RAM). Larger circuits are possible, but RAM usage doubles with each additional qubit. |\n",

    "| [quimb](https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | quimb | Not based on `cirq.Simulator`; instead uses a Cirq-to-quimb translation layer provided in `contrib/quimb`. In addition to circuit simulation, this allows the use of quimb circuit-analysis tools on Cirq circuits. |\n",
    "| [qFlex](https://github.com/ngnrsaa/qflex) | qflexcirq | Implements `cirq.SimulatesAmplitudes`. RAM usage is highly dependent on the number of two-qubit gates in the circuit. Not recommended - prefer qsim or quimb. |\n"

  - heading: Manage noise when running circuits
    description: Running circuits on quantum hardware devices means dealing with the
      noise those devices introduce to the computation. Cirq provides the following
      ways of managing that noise, to improve the quality of the measured results.

    description: Characterize the error a device is exhibiting, then compensate for
      that error by changing the circuit or reinterpreting the results.

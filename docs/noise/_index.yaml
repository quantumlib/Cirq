    - heading: Manage noise when running circuits
      description: Running circuits on real quantum devices means dealing with the noise those devices introduce to the computation. Cirq provides different ways to managing that noise, to improve the reliability of a circuit when run on hardware.
    - heading: Characterization and compensation
      description: By first characterizing how much and what kinds of error a device is exhibiting, compensation can be used to improve the reliability of the next run on the device or interpret the results of a previous run more accurately.

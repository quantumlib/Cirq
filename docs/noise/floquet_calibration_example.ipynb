    "This simulation can be looked at as a highly simplified version of the paper from our group, [Observation of separated dynamics of charge and spin in the Fermi-Hubbard model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07965). We model only a single fermion in the non-interacting case (with $U=0$). For a single particle, the parasitic controlled phase does not impact the evolution, and we can use a single chain that one can think about it as being in either up or down spin states. The parameter $\\theta$ for $K(\\theta)$ is fixed to $\\pi/4$. To smooth out the inhomogeneities of the quantum chip, we are using the technique of _averaging over multiple qubit configurations_ from this paper. The difference is that we pick a line that we segment and run the same circuit in parallel on each segment corresponding to a different qubit configuration. We measure the charge density at each site index (qubit) by averaging the Z densities (see Fig 2.a for comparison). \n",

This paper also describes the Floquet calibration fundamentals in Appendix A."

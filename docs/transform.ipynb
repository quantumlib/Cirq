These can be used to transform a circuit in specific ways, such as combining single-qubit gates, commuting Z gates through the circuit, or readying the circuit for certain hardware or gate set configurations.\n",

    "*   **EjectZ**:  Pushes Z gates towards the end of the circuit, potentially adjusting phases of gates that they pass through.\n",

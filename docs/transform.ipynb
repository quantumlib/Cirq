    "A transformer in Cirq is any callable, that satisfies the `cirq.TRANSFORMER` API, and *transforms* an input circuit into an output circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit transformations are often necessary to compile a user-defined circuit to an equivalent circuit, which can be executed on a specific device or simulator. The compilation process often involves steps like:\n",
    "- Gate Decompositions: Rewrite the circuit using only gates that belong to the device target gateset, i.e. set of gates which the device can execute. \n",
    "- Qubit Mapping and Routing: Map the logic qubits in the input circuit to physical qubits on the device and insert appropriate swap operations such that final circuit respects the hardware topology. \n",
    "- Circuit Optimizations: Perform hardware specific optimizations, like merging and replacing connected components of 1 and 2 operations with more efficient rewrites, commuting Z gates through the circuit, aligning gates in moments etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq provides many out-of-the-box transformers which can be used as individual compilation passes and also provides a general framework for users to create their own transformers using powerful primitives and bundle a bunch of transformers together to enable compiling circuits for specific targets.

    "*   **cirq.align_left / cirq.align_right**: Align gates to the left/right of the circuit.\n",

    "*   **cirq.drop_empty_moments** / **cirq.drop_negligible_operations**:  Removes moments that are empty or operations that have very small effects, respectively.\n",
    "*   **cirq.eject_phased_paulis**: Pushes X, Y, and PhasedX gates towards the end of the circuit, potentially absorbing Z gates and modifying gates along the way.\n",
    "*   **cirq.eject_z**:  Pushes Z gates towards the end of the circuit, potentially adjusting phases of gates that they pass through.\n",
    "*   **cirq.expand_composite**:  Uses `cirq.decompose` to expand composite gates.\n",
    "*   **cirq.merge_k_qubit_unitaries**: Replaces connected components of unitary operations, acting on <= k qubits, with op-tree given by `rewriter(circuit_op)`.\n",
    "*   **cirq.optimize_for_target_gateset**: Attempts to convert a circuit into and equivalent circuit using only gates from a given target gateset.\n",
    "*   **cirq.stratified_circuit**: Repacks the circuit to ensure that moments only contain operations from the same category.\n",
    "*   **cirq.synchronize_terminal_measurements**:  Moves all terminal measurements in a circuit to the final moment, if possible.\n",

    "## Concept of Circuit Parameterization and Sweeps\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a quantum circuit and in this circuit there is a gate with some parameter. You might wish to run this circuit for different values of this parameter.  An example of this type of circuit is a Rabi flop experiment. This experiment runs a set of quantum computations which 1) starts in  $|0\\rangle$ state, 2) rotates the state by $\\theta$ about the $x$ axis, i.e. applies the gate $\\exp(i \\theta X)$, and 3) measures the state in the computational basis.  Running this experiment for multiple values of $\\theta$, and plotting the probability of observing a $|1\\rangle$ outcome yields the quintessential $\\cos^2$ probability distribution as a function of the parameter $\\theta$.  To support this type of experiment, Cirq provides the concept of parameterized circuits and parameter sweeps.  \n",

    "- Cirq circuits can handle arbitrary Sympy expressions in place of exponents and parameter arguments in operations.\n",
    "- By providing one or a sequence of `ParamResolver`s or dictionaries that resolve the Sympy variables to values, `run`, `simulate`, and other functions can iterate efficiently over different parameter assignments for otherwise identical circuits. \n",
    "- Sweeps can be created succinctly with `cirq.Points` and `cirq.Linspace`, and composed with each other with `*` and `+`, to create `cirq.Product` and `cirq.Zip` sweeps. \n",
    "- When the service you're using does not support arbitrary expressions, you can flatten a circuit and sweep into a new circuit that doesn't have complex expressions, and a corresponding new sweep. "

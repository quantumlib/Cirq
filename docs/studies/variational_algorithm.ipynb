        "\n",
        "The [variational method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_method_(quantum_mechanics)) in quantum theory is a classical method for finding low energy states of a quantum system. The rough idea of this method is that one defines a trial wave function (sometimes called an *ansatz*) as a function of some parameters, and then one finds the values of these parameters that minimize the expectation value of the energy with respect to these parameters. This minimized ansatz is then an approximation to the lowest energy eigenstate, and the expectation value serves as an upper bound on the energy of the ground state.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last few years (see [arXiv:1304.3061](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3061) and [arXiv:1507.08969](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08969), for example), it has been realized that quantum computers can mimic the classical technique and that a quantum computer does so with certain advantages. In particular, when one applies the classical variational method to a system of $n$ qubits, an exponential number (in $n$) of complex numbers is necessary to generically represent the wave function of the system. However, with a quantum computer, one can directly produce this state using a parameterized quantum circuit, and then by repeated measurements estimate the expectation value of the energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "This idea has led to a class of algorithms known as variational quantum algorithms. Indeed this approach is not just limited to finding low energy eigenstates, but minimizing any objective function that can be expressed as a quantum observable. It is an open question to identify under what conditions these quantum variational algorithms will succeed, and exploring this class of algorithms is a key part of the research for [noisy intermediate scale quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862).\n",
        "\n",
        "The classical problem we will focus on is the 2D +/- Ising model with transverse field ([ISING](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/15/10/028/meta)). This problem is NP-complete. So it is highly unlikely that quantum computers will be able to efficiently solve it across all instances. Yet this type of problem is illustrative of the general class of problems that Cirq is designed to tackle.\n",

        "\n",
        "where here each $s_i, J_{i,j}$, and $h_i$ are either +1 or -1. Here each index i is associated with a bit on a square lattice, and the $<i,j>$ notation means sums over neighboring bits on this lattice. The problem we would like to solve is, given $J_{i,j}$, and $h_i$, find an assignment of $s_i$ values that minimize $E$.\n",
        "\n",
        "How does a variational quantum algorithm work for this? One approach is to consider $n$ qubits and associate them with each of the bits in the classical problem. This maps the classical problem onto the quantum problem of minimizing the expectation value of the observable\n",
        "\n",
        "$H=\\sum_{<i,j>} J_{i,j} Z_i Z_j + \\sum_i h_iZ_i$\n",
        "\n",
        "Then one defines a set of parameterized quantum circuits, i.e., a quantum circuit where the gates (or more general quantum operations) are parameterized by some values. This produces an ansatz state\n",

        "$|\\psi(p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k)\\rangle$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $p_i$ are the parameters that produce this state (here we assume a pure state, but mixed states are of course possible).\n",
        "\n",
        "The variational algorithm then works by noting that one can obtain the value of the objective function for a given ansatz state by\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Prepare the ansatz state.\n",
        "2. Make a measurement which samples from some terms in H.\n",
        "3. Goto 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that one cannot always measure $H$ directly (without the use of quantum phase estimation). So one often relies on the linearity of expectation values to measure parts of $H$ in step 2. One always needs to repeat the measurements to obtain an estimate of the expectation value. How many measurements needed to achieve a given accuracy is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but Cirq can help investigate this question.\n",
        "\n",
        "The above shows that one can use a quantum computer to obtain estimates of the objective function for the ansatz. This can then be used in an outer loop to try to obtain parameters for the lowest value of the objective function. For these values, one can then use that best ansatz to produce samples of solutions to the problem, which obtain a hopefully good approximation for the lowest possible value of the objective function.\n"

For example, it does not allow for access to the amplitudes of the wave function of the system, since that is not experimentally accessible. *Simulate* commands, however, are broader and allow different forms of simulation. When prototyping small circuits, it is useful to execute *simulate* methods, but one should be wary of relying on them when running against actual hardware.\n",

This, in principle, allows us to simulate any circuit that has gates that implement one and two qubit `KnownMatrix` gates. Future releases of Cirq will expand these simulators.\n",

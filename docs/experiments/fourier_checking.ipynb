    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Supposing we have a boolean function $f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow\\{-1, 1\\}$. The function is drawn either from distribution $\\mathcal{B}$ or $\\mathcal{C}$. Under the distribution $\\mathcal{B}$, the function $f$ is balanced, i.e., $\\sum_{x} f(x) = 0$. Under the distribution $\\mathcal{C}$, the function $f$ is constant, i.e., function is always equal to $+1$ or $-1$. The problem is to accept the function if it is drawn from $\\mathcal{B}$ or reject it otherwise.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remembering that the function is guaranteed to be either balanced or constant, not somewhere in between. So above algorithm is guaranteed to be always correct. However, the query complexity is $O(N)$, denoting $N=2^n$. Here we are interested in the query complexity instead of computation complexity. Namely, how many times we have to evaluate $f$ -- which you can imagine being a very costly function. If the bounded-error probability is acceptable for solving the problem, we can achieve better algorithm in terms of query complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Algorithm**: Randomly select $K$ different inputs and evaluate the corresponding outputs. If both $+1$ and $-1$ are observed, we accept it. Otherwise, it reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of algorithm depends on the choice of $K$. For this problem, selecting fixed number is sufficient, i.e. $O(1)$ query complexity. It is worth to remark that $O(1)$ means no matter the fixed number is independent of the input size of function $N$. Consider the $K=2$ case, it is not hard to establish the following confusion matrix regardless of $N$:\n",

    "Recall that the B in BPP means *bounded-error*. Actually, you can achieve arbitary small error rate under the same query complexity order. Say, you set an acceptable error rate $\\epsilon$. Then the key is that we can run the algorithm multiple times. Repeat it as many times as you want until the error rate is lower than $\\epsilon$. It is crucial to note that the error rate for this particular problem does not depend on the size of the input but only on the size of the sample and the reptitation. For this reason, in order to get to a bounded probability error, it is sufficient to just adjust the sample size and/or repetitions to a given constant - which means that the \"query complexity\" of the algorithm will stay $O(1)$. For example, let's run previous algorithms 3 times and make the final decision based on the majority of the decision of each term. You should verify that the probability of error indeed decreased and independent of $N$."

  - heading: Experiments using quantum circuits
    description: This is a collection of algorithms and experiments written in and
      using Cirq. A couple of them use only base Cirq, but the rest use additional
      code stored in ReCirq, a GitHub repository for research code that uses and builds
      upon Cirq.

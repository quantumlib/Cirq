    "## Classical random walks\n",
    "\n",
    "A random walk is a random process involving a \"walker\" that is placed in some $n$-dimensional medium, like a grid or a graph. \n",
    "We then repeatedly query some random variable, and based on the outcome of our measurement,\n",
    "the walker's position vector (position on the graph or grid) is updated. A basic example of a random walk is \n",
    "the one-dimensional graphical case, where we consider a marker placed on the origin of a number line with markings\n",
    "at each of the integers. Let the initial position vector of our marker be $\\lvert 0\\rangle$. For $N$ steps of our\n",
    "random walk, take a set of $N$ random variables $\\{X_1, \\ ..., \\ X_N\\}$, which can take on either a value of \n",
    "$1$ or $-1$ with equal probability. To find the updated position vector of our walker, we compute\n",
    "the value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$j \\ = \\ \\displaystyle\\sum_{k \\ = \\ 1}^{N} \\ X_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lvert \\text{Final}\\rangle \\ = \\ \\lvert \\text{Initial} \\ + \\ j\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So for our case, the final position vector is $\\lvert j\\rangle$. This model of a random walk can \n",
    "be generalized to $n$-dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important fact to note is that for a discrete, 1-dimensional random \n",
    "walk on a number-line-like graph, the probability of the random walker being at a specific location follows \n",
    "a [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution). Let us define an $N$-step random walk. Let us then assert that $N \\ = \\ L \\ + \\ R$, \n",
    "where $L$ is the number of steps to the left, and $R$ is the number of steps to the right. We can then reason \n",
    "that if there is some probability $p_{r}$ of the walker taking a rightward step at one time-step of the random \n",
    "walk, the probability of taking a leftward step is given by $1 \\ - \\ p_{r}$. It follows that the probability \n",
    "of taking $L \\ = \\ N \\ - \\ R$ leftward steps, and $R$ rightward steps in a random walk of $N$ total steps is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "We then have to consider the probability that for an $N$ step random walk, our walker ends up at position \n",
    "$X \\ = \\ R \\ - \\ L$. Well, we know the probability of taking $L$ left steps and $R$ right steps, and we know \n",
    "that for a random walk of $N$ steps, the position of the walker is determined by the number of right steps, \n",
    "minus the number of left steps. Since it doesn't matter the order in which the sequence of $N$ steps occurs, \n",
    "to find the total probability of being at some location, $P(X)$, we have to multiply the probability $P(L, \\ R)$ \n",
    "by the number of possible ways in which $L$ left steps and $R$ right steps can be arranged in a sequence. \n",
    "Well, since we have $N$ total steps, we can \"choose\" $R$ of those steps to be allocated to rightward steps, \n",
    "and automatically know that the remaining $N \\ - \\ R$ steps were left steps. We calculate $N$ \"choose\" $R$ \n",
    "steps by calculating the binomial coefficient, therefore getting:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{N}(X) \\ = \\ \\begin{pmatrix} N \\\\ R \\end{pmatrix} \\ p_{r}^R (1 \\ - \\ p_{r})^{N \\ - \\ R} \\Rightarrow \\ X \\ = \\ R \\ - \\ L \\ \\Rightarrow \\ P_{N}(X) \\ = \\ \\begin{pmatrix} N \\\\ \\frac{N \\ + \\ X}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\ p_{r}^{\\frac{N \\ + \\ X}{2}} (1 \\ - \\ p_{r})^{\\frac{N \\ - \\ X}{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this only holds true for **even numbers** if the total number of steps taken is even, and **odd numbers** if the total number of steps taken is odd. This is due to the fact that if we set the number of steps that the random walk can take to $N$, then as we previously demonstrated, $L \\ + \\ R \\ = \\ N$ and $R \\ - \\ L \\ = \\ X$. Combining these two equations, we get, just like in the equation above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R \\ = \\ \\frac{X \\ + \\ N}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But $R$ must be an integer, thus $X \\ + \\ N$. Must be even. It follows that if $N$ is odd, then $X$ must also be odd to make an even number, and if $N$ is even, $X$ must also be even. From this, we come to the conclusion that if we have an even $N$, the probability of being at a position $X$ that is an odd value is $0$, and if $N$ is odd, then the probability of $X$ being even is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we have shown that the probability distribution for the position of the walker for an $N$ step random \n",
    "walk is given by a binomial distribution on the domain of the even or the odd numbers. This fact is important, as we will show that the probability distribution that is created when a quantum walk is simulated is nowhere close to the binomial distribution that we expect to see for a classical 1-dimensional random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't believe me and/or the math, we can visualize this a bit better by coding up a simple program! We will define a one-dimensional random walk, starting at the point $0$ on the integer number line. We will then repeatedly \"flip a coin\", and move left and right down the number line accordingly: "

    "## Quantum walks\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of the quantum walk isn't that much different from its classical counterpart, although \n",
    "the observed results of the two processes have many differences. First, let us motivate the creation of a \n",
    "QW. The idea is that when one performs analysis on a classical random walk, you can find that \n",
    "$\\sigma^2 \\ \\sim \\ T$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the random walk's probability distribution, \n",
    "and $T$ is the number of time-steps of the random walk. For the quantum walk, we can see that \n",
    "$\\sigma^2 \\ \\sim \\ T^2$. In other words, the standard deviation grows at a quadratically faster rate. \n",
    "At a high level, this signifies that the quantum walker \"spreads out\" quadratically faster than the \n",
    "classical one, showing that the process of a QW is quadratically faster than its classical counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a quantum walk, we have to translate the components of the classical random walk \n",
    "to a quantum problem. We can encode the position of a \"walker\" in some $n$ -dimensional space with a vector\n",
    "$\\lvert j\\rangle$. For the purpose of this project, we will be investigating a basic case of a \n",
    "random walk on a ring-shaped graph, with adjacent nodes connected by a single edge. The configuration \n",
    "looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/cycle.png\" style=\"width:550px;height:500px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our original idea of some position vector $\\lvert j\\rangle$, it is apparent that in order to \n",
    "encode the location of a \"walker\" on this graph, we need to assign a specific value of our position vector \n",
    "to each node. Well, this is fairly simple, for a graph of $K$ nodes, we form a Hilbert space\n",
    "$H_W$ spanned by the following set:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_W \\ = \\ \\{\\lvert j\\rangle \\ : \\ j \\ = \\ 0, \\ ..., \\ K \\ - \\ 1 \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also require another vector in order to create a random walk. We need a \"coin vector\", which will encode \n",
    "the direction in which the random walk will progress at the $T$-th step of the process. This Hilbert space \n",
    "is spanned by the two basis states, representing forward and backward progression on our number-line-like \n",
    "graph (actually, our graph looks more like a ring, so the two basis states will represent \n",
    "clockwise and counter-clockwise motion, but it's the same idea). We will call this Hilbert space $H_C$, \n",
    "and we can again define our spanning set:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_C \\ = \\ \\{\\lvert i\\rangle \\ : \\ i \\ = \\ \\downarrow, \\ \\uparrow\\rangle\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the upward-arrow symbol represent counter-clockwise motion, and the downward arrow represents \n",
    "clock-wise motion. Now that we have defined all of the vectors we need to encode the information about \n",
    "our random walk, we must understand how we can realize these vectors in our quantum algorithm. Well, this is \n",
    "again fairly simple. For a graph of $K \\ = \\ 2^n$ nodes, we require $n$ qubits to encode binary representations \n",
    "of numbers ranging from $0$ to $K \\ - \\ 1$, therefore each of the vectors spanning $H_W$ will be given \n",
    "by the binary representation of $j$ corresponding to the basis vector $\\lvert j\\rangle$. For the coin vector, \n",
    "since we have only two states, we only need one qubit to encode the two possible states:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lvert 0\\rangle \\ = \\ \\lvert \\uparrow\\rangle \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\lvert 1\\rangle \\ = \\ \\lvert \\downarrow\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent the total space of all possible states of our system, we take the tensor product of the \n",
    "two spanning sets, which will then span the new Hilbert space $H_C \\ \\otimes \\ H_W$. We will write a general \n",
    "element of this Hilbert space as $\\lvert i\\rangle \\ \\otimes \\ \\lvert j\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving right along, we now require a method to evolve our walk forward at each step. We define a random \n",
    "walk evolution operator as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$U \\ = \\ \\lvert \\uparrow\\rangle\\langle\\uparrow\\lvert  \\ \\otimes \\ \\displaystyle\\sum_{j} \\ \\lvert j \\ + \\ 1\\rangle\\langle j\\lvert  \\ + \\ \\lvert \\downarrow\\rangle\\langle\\downarrow\\lvert  \\ \\otimes \\ \\displaystyle\\sum_{j} \\ \\lvert j \\ - \\ 1\\rangle\\langle j\\lvert $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, since our qubits take on states $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ and $\\lvert 1\\rangle$, we know that \n",
    "any possible, general basis state vector formed from qubits $\\lvert n\\rangle^{\\otimes \\ N}$ will be orthogonal to \n",
    "all other vectors in the basis spanning the space. Because of this, we can create an operator that first \n",

    "they're orthonormal!), and the new position state of the vector is $\\lvert j \\ \\pm \\ 1\\rangle$, depending on \n",
    "the state of the coin vector. This did exactly what we wanted, it evolved our walk either forward or \n",
    "backwards by one step! If you're still not convinced, let's check to see what happens when we have the state \n",
    "$\\lvert \\uparrow\\rangle \\ \\otimes \\ \\lvert 1\\rangle$ and we apply the $U$ operator:\n",

    "Now we can get back to creating the addition and subtraction operators. Starting with the addition operator, \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have a $CNOT$ gate controlled by the coin qubit targeting the least significant qubit. This means that if the coin qubit is in the \"move forward\" state, the addition operator will be activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply an $X$ gate to the qubit that was just targeted by the $CNOT$ gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Apply a Toffoli gate controlled by the coin qubit and the qubit on which the $X$ gate was just placed, targetting the second least-significant qubit. This acts as a \"carry operation\", meaning that if the coin qubit is in the addition state, and the least significant qubit is in the $|0\\rangle$ state (meaning it was in the $|1\\rangle$ state, but had the $CNOT$ operation applied to it, we had to apply the $X$ gate to flip it back to the $|1\\rangle$ state so it can activate the Toffoli gate), then flip the value of the next qubit, signifying that the addition mod $2$ carried over a one to the next digit of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Continue this process with $n$-qubit Toffoli gates controlled by all qubits less significant than the target qubit, along with the coin qubit until all qubits have had Toffoli gates applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Apply $X$ gates to all qubits in the position vector register, as they all had $X$ gates applied to them in the process of addition (This jusst cancels out when we apply the inverse operator to perform subtraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the subtraction operator, we can make use of the fact that quantum operations are reversible, meaning that if \n",
    "we have some addition unitary $A$, such that $A |j\\rangle \\ = \\ |j \\ + \\ 1\\rangle$, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A^{\\dagger}A |j\\rangle \\ = \\ A^{\\dagger}|j \\ + \\ 1\\rangle \\ \\Rightarrow \\ A^{\\dagger}|j \\ + \\ 1\\rangle \\ = \\ |j\\rangle \\ \\Rightarrow \\ A^{\\dagger}|k\\rangle \\ = \\ |k \\ - \\ 1\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And so this means that $S \\ = \\ A^{\\dagger}$. Since we can decompose $A$ into a product of a bunch of unitaries, \n",
    "we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " $$A \\ = \\ U_1 U_2 \\ ... \\ U_n \\ \\Rightarrow \\ S \\ = \\ A^{\\dagger} \\ = \\ U_n^{\\dagger} U_{n - 1}^{\\dagger} \\ ... \\ U_{1}^{\\dagger}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But our method only uses $X$ gates and controlled $X$ gates, all of which are Hermitian, thus we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S \\ = \\ U_n^{\\dagger} U_{n - 1}^{\\dagger} \\ ... \\ U_{1}^{\\dagger} \\ = \\ U_n U_{n - 1} \\ ... \\ U_{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, our subtraction operation will just be applying our addition operator, but with the order of \n",

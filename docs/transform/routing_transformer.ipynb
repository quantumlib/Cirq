Moreover, this placement is often not enough to guarantee that all 2-qubit operations between logical qubits in the ciruit correpond to 2-qubit operations between physical qubits on the device that are adjacent. So in addition to mapping logical qubits to physical qubits, it is often required to insert additional SWAP gates in the circuit to ensure that all 2-qubit operations are executed between physically adjacent qubits."

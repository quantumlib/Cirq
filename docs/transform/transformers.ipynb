    "## What is a Transformer?\n",
    "A transformer in Cirq is any callable that satisfies the `cirq.TRANSFORMER` API, and *transforms* an input circuit into an output circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit transformations are often necessary to compile a user-defined circuit to an equivalent circuit that satisfies the constraints necessary to be executable on a specific device or simulator. The compilation process often involves steps like:\n",
    "- Gate Decompositions: Rewrite the circuit using only gates that belong to the device target gateset, i.e. set of gates which the device can execute. \n",
    "- Qubit Mapping and Routing: Map the logic qubits in the input circuit to physical qubits on the device and insert appropriate swap operations such that final circuit respects the hardware topology. \n",
    "- Circuit Optimizations: Perform hardware specific optimizations, like merging and replacing connected components of 1 and 2 operations with more efficient rewrite operations, commuting Z gates through the circuit, aligning gates in moments and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq provides many out-of-the-box transformers which can be used as individual compilation passes. It also supplies a general framework for users to create their own transformers, by using powerful primitives and by bundling existing transformers together, to enable the compilation of circuits for specific targets. This page covers the available transformers in Cirq, how to use them, and how to write a simple transformer. The [Custom Transformers](./transformers.ipynb) page presents the details on creating more complex custom transformers through primitives and composition."

    "Transformers that come with cirq can be found in the [`/cirq/transformers`](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/cirq-core/cirq/transformers) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notable examples are:\n",
    "*   **`cirq.align_left` / `cirq.align_right`**: Align gates to the left/right of the circuit by sliding them as far as possible along each qubit in the chosen direction.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.defer_measurements`**:  Moves all (non-terminal) measurements in a circuit to the end of circuit by implementing the deferred measurement principle.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.drop_empty_moments`** / **`cirq.drop_negligible_operations`**:  Removes moments that are empty or operations that have very small effects, respectively.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.eject_phased_paulis`**: Pushes X, Y, and PhasedX gates towards the end of the circuit, potentially absorbing Z gates and modifying gates along the way.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.eject_z`**:  Pushes Z gates towards the end of the circuit, potentially adjusting phases of gates that they pass through.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.expand_composite`**:  Uses `cirq.decompose` to expand gates built from other gates (composite gates).\n",
    "*   **`cirq.merge_k_qubit_unitaries`**: Replaces connected components of unitary operations, acting on <= k qubits, with op-tree given by `rewriter(circuit_op)`.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.optimize_for_target_gateset`**: Attempts to convert a circuit into an equivalent circuit using only gates from a given target gateset.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.stratified_circuit`**: Repacks the circuit to ensure that moments only contain operations from the same category.\n",
    "*   **`cirq.synchronize_terminal_measurements`**:  Moves all terminal measurements in a circuit to the final moment, if possible.\n",

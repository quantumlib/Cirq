        "Cirq circuits allow for gates to have symbols as free parameters within the circuit.  This is especially useful for variational algorithms, which vary parameters within the circuit in order to optimize a cost function, but it can be useful in a variety of circumstances.\n",
        "\n",
        "For parameters, cirq uses the library `sympy` to add `sympy.Symbol` as parameters to gates and operations.  \n",
        "\n",

        "*   `cirq.Points`: A list of manually specified values for one specific symbol as a sequence of floats\n",
        "*   `cirq.Linspace`: A linear sweep from a starting value to an ending value.\n",
        "*   `cirq.ListSweep`: A list of manually specified values for several different symbols, specified as a list of dictionaries.\n",
        "*   `cirq.Zip` and `cirq.Product`: Sweeps can be combined list-wise by zipping them together or through their Cartesian product.\n",
        "\n",
        "A parameterized circuit and sweep together can be run using the simulator or other sampler by changing `run()` to `run_sweep()` and adding the sweep as a parameter.\n",

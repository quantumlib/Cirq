    "Cirq provides the [Pauli operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices){:.external} `X`, `Y` and `Z` as `cirq.X`, `cirq.Y` and `cirq.Z` respectively. Together with the identity operator `cirq.I`, these three operators form a complete basis for the set of all unitary transformations on a single qubit. That is, any quantum circuit on a single qubit can be represented by a linear combination (weighted sum) of the `X`,`Y`,`Z` and `I` operators applied to that qubit. This extends to quantum circuits of any number of qubits in the sense that any multi-qubit quantum circuit that doesn't entangle qubits can be represented by a linear combination of tensor products of Pauli operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Observables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable){:.external} are, in general, some sort of measurable property of a circuit. At its very simplest, this could be whether a qubit measures to be $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ in the standard computational basis. In the Pauli basis, this corresponds to the `Z` observable. In general, this is roughly a way to measure qubit state in a basis other than the computational one, by applying basis-changing operations before measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Cirq, compositions, linear combinations, and tensor products of Pauli operators are represented with `cirq.PauliString` and `cirq.PauliSum`, which this tutorial will demonstrate next. Fundamentally, these objects are still [Operations](./operators.ipynb), and can be added to circuits like any other operation. The second half of this tutorial will cover the second use of `PauliString`s, as observables in measurement. "

    "## Using `PauliString` as observables\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the `PauliString`s and compositions thereof are still `cirq.Operation`s, meaning they can be used in circuits like any other `Operation`. However, they have unique ability to be used as [observables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable){:.external} during measurement. Observables are typically some sort of measurable property (of a quantum state). \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Measuring an observable\" usually amounts to applying the observable to the final quantum state and measuring in the standard computational basis, but is representative of measuring whether that observable's property holds. It is equivalent to (in many cases) or conceptually similar to a change of basis, meaning \"measuring an observable\" is roughly the same as measuring in some basis other than the computational one.\n",

    "### Measure a single observable\n",
    "\n",
    "`cirq.measure_single_paulistring` serves to package the observable into a `cirq.MeasurementGate`-line object, a `cirq.PauliMeasurementgate`, which applies the observable as if it were an operation, and then measures all of the qubits that appear in the observable. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one critical, additional step that `measure_single_paulistring` performs beyond simply applying the observable and measuring. It identifies the [eigenstates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_eigenstates){:.external} of the observable and returns a single bit of information, whether the final state of the qubits in question is in one of those eigenstates (`0`) or not (`1`). For example, the eigenstates of the `ZZ` observable (aka. `cirq.Z(a) * cirq.Z(b)`), are $|00\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle$ for the two qubits `a` and `b`. "

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq's protocols are very similar concept to Python's built-in protocols that were introduced in [PEP 544](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/).\n",
    "Python's built-in protocols are extremely convenient. For example, behind all the for loops and list comprehensions you can find the Iterator protocol.\n",
    "As long as an object has the `__iter__()` magic method that returns an iterator object, it has iterator support.\n",
    "An iterator object has to define `__iter__()` and `__next__()` magic methods, that defines the iterator protocol.\n",
    "The `iter(val)` builtin function returns an iterator for `val` if it defines the above methods, otherwise throws a `TypeError`. Cirq protocols work similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A canonical Cirq protocol example is the `unitary` protocol that allows to check the unitary matrix of values that support the protocol by calling `cirq.unitary(val)`."

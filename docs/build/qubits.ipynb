    "\n",
    "- `cirq.NamedQubit` - an abstract qubit that only has a name, nothing else. Use this when you don't need anything else and you don't need to create too many qubits in bulk.\n",
    "- `cirq.LineQubit` - a qubit that is identified by an integer index in a line. Some devices have lines of qubits, `LineQubit` can be useful to represent that. Also `cirq.LineQubit.range(3)` is a very easy way to create 3 qubits.  \n",
    "- `cirq.GridQubit` - a qubit that is placed on a grid and is identified by the 2D coordinates. Most of Google's chips are represented using `GridQubit`s. \n",

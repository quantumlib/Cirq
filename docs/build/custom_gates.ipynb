    "  of sub-values that can be compared for equality.\n",
    "  * Arithmetic functions such as `__pow__`, `__mul__`, `__add__` define the\n",

    "information.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Operations and gates can be defined in terms of other operations by implementing\n",

    "`_decompose_(self)` whereas gates implement `_decompose_(self, qubits)`\n",
    "(since gates don't know their qubits ahead of time).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main requirements on the output of `_decompose_` methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DO NOT CREATE CYCLES. The `cirq.decompose` method will iterative decompose until it finds values satisfying a `keep` predicate. Cycles cause it to enter an infinite loop.\n",
    "2. Head towards operations defined by Cirq, because these operations have good decomposition methods that terminate in single-qubit and two qubit gates.\n",
    "These gates can be understood by the simulator, optimizers, and other code.\n",
    "3. All that matters is functional equivalence.\n",
    "Don't worry about staying within or reaching a particular gate set; it's too hard to predict what the caller will want. Gate-set-aware decomposition is useful, but *this is not the protocol that does that*.\n",
    "Instead, use features available in the [transformer API](../transform/transformers.ipynb#compiling_to_nisq_targets_cirqcompilationtargetgateset).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `cirq.CCZ` decomposes into a series of `cirq.CNOT` and `cirq.T` operations.\n",
    "This allows code that doesn't understand three-qubit operation to work with `cirq.CCZ`; by decomposing it into operations they do understand.\n",
    "As another example, `cirq.TOFFOLI` decomposes into a `cirq.H` followed by a `cirq.CCZ` followed by a `cirq.H`.\n",
    "Although the output contains a three qubit operation (the CCZ), that operation can be decomposed into two qubit and one qubit operations.\n",
    "So code that doesn't understand three qubit operations can deal with Toffolis by decomposing them, and then decomposing the CCZs that result from the initial decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, decomposition-aware code consuming operations is expected to recursively decompose unknown operations until the code either hits operations it understands or hits a dead end where no more decomposition is possible.\n",
    "The `cirq.decompose` method implements logic for performing exactly this kind of recursive decomposition.\n",
    "Callers specify a `keep` predicate, and optionally specify intercepting and fallback decomposers, and then `cirq.decompose` will repeatedly decompose whatever operations it was given until the operations satisfy the given `keep`.\n",
    "If `cirq.decompose` hits a dead end, it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq doesn't make any guarantees about the \"target gate set\" decomposition is heading towards.\n",

    "(If no `default` is specified and `value` isn't invertible, a `TypeError` is raised.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you give `cirq.inverse` a list, or any other kind of iterable thing, it will return a sequence of operations that (if run in order) undoes the operations of the original sequence (if run in order).\n",
    "Basically, the items of the list are individually inverted and returned in reverse order.\n",
    "For example, the expression `cirq.inverse([cirq.S(b), cirq.CNOT(a, b)])` will return the tuple `(cirq.CNOT(a, b), cirq.S(b)**-1)`.\n",

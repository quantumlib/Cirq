A qu-*d*-it is a generalization of a qubit to a d-level or d-dimension system.  For example, the state of a single qubit is a superposition of two basis states, $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$, whereas the state of a qudit for a three dimensional system is a superposition of three basis states $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle+\\gamma|2\\rangle$.\n",

When you specify `_qid_shape_` we say that the object implements the `qid_shape` protocol.\n",

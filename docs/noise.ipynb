    "\n",
    "This method should return the sequence of `numpy` matrices corresponding to the Krauss operators. The basis in which this matrix is expressed is always implicit with respect to the object being called. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in `GateOperations`, these matrices must be ordered with respect to the list of qubits that the channel is applied to. The qubit-to-amplitude order mapping matches the ordering of `numpy.kron(A, B)`, where `A` is a qubit earlier in the list than the qubit `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one has defined `_channel_`, then that `Gate` and any `GateOperation`\n",

    "\n",
    "Besides objects that support `_channel_`, `cirq.channel` will also fall\n",
    "back to other objects that can be interpreted as channels. For example, if a channel is a probabilistic mixture of unitary gates (see below), then `cirq.channel` will fall back to seeing if the object supports `_mixture_`. If `_mixture_` is not supported, then `cirq.channel` checks to see if `_unitary_` is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to supporting `_channel_`, objects that are channels should also implement `_has_channel_(self) -> bool` to return `True`. This method is used to determine whether an object has a `_channel_` or not without having to do the potentially expensive creation of the matrices for the channel."

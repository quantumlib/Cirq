      description: >
        <p>
        Cirq is a software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing
        quantum circuits and then running them against quantum computers and
        simulators. Cirq attempts to expose the details of hardware, instead of
        abstracting them away, because, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
        (NISQ) regime, these details determine whether or not it is possible to
        execute a circuit at all.
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Cirq is currently in alpha.</em> Parts of the Cirq API may change or
        remove for new releases. To be informed of deprecations and breaking
        changes, subscribe to the

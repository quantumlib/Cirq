    "\n",
    "It's well-known that some problems can be solved on the quantum computer exponentially faster than on the classical one in terms of computation time. However, there is more subtle way in which quantum computers are more powerful. There is a problem, which can be solved by quantum circuit of constant depth, but can't be solved by classical circuit of constant depth. In this notebook we will consider this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by giving formal statement of the problem. Then we solve this problem in a straightforward way, which follows directly from the problem definition. We will use this solution to verify our quantum solution in the next part. Also, this part contains helper code to generate \"interesting\" instances of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part we solve this problem with Cirq. First, we write a code which builds a quantum circuit for solving arbitrary instances of the problem. Then we use Cirq's Clifford simulator to simulate this circuit. We do it for small instances and compare results to the brute force solution from the previous part. Then, we solve the problem for a larger instance of the problem to demonstrate that it can be solved efficiently.\n",

    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we consider a [quadratic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form) of a [binary vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array) and with binary coefficients (but additions and multiplications are evaluated modulo 4). Then we restrict this quadratic form, i.e. we allow to use only certain binary vectors as input. It turns out that under this restriction this quadratic form is equivalent to a linear function, i.e. it just evaluates dot product of input vector and certain scalar vector. Task is to find this scalar vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have a linear function, which is \"hidden\" inside a quadratic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal statement of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{n \\times n}$ - upper-triangular binary matrix of size $n \\times n$, $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n$ - binary vector of length $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function $q : \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\to \\mathbb{Z}_4$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q(x) = (2 x^T A x + b^T x) ~\\text{mod}~ 4 = \\left(2 \\sum_{i,j}A_{i,j}x_i x_j + \\sum_{i} b_i x_i \\right) ~\\text{mod}~ 4 , $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Also define\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_q = \\Big\\{x \\in  \\mathbb{F}_2^n : q(x \\oplus y) = (q(x) + q(y)) ~\\text{mod}~ 4 ~~ \\forall y \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\Big\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out (see Lemma 1 on page 6 in [1]) that restriction of $q$ on $\\mathcal{L}_q$ is a linear function, i.e. there exists such $z \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n$, that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q(x) = 2 z^T x ~~\\forall x \\in \\mathcal{L}_q.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is, given $A$ and $b$, to find $z$. There may be multiple answers - we need to find any such answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation in the problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* $q$ - quadratic form; $A$ - matrix of its quadratic coefficients; $b$ - vector of its linear coefficients;\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{L}_q$ - linear space on which we restrict $q(x)$ in order to get linear function;\n",
    "* $z$ - vector of coefficients of the linear function we get by restricting $q$ on $\\mathcal{L}_q$. This vector is \"hidden\" in the coefficients of $q$ and the problem is to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this problem interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. It's a problem without an oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other problems where task is to find coefficients of a linear function. But usually the linear function is represented by an [oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine). See, for example, [Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein%E2%80%93Vazirani_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we avoid use of an oracle by \"hiding\" the linear function in the coefficients of quadratic form $A$ and $b$, which are the only inputs to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Quantum circuits have advantage over classical when solving this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will show below, this problem can be solved with a Clifford circuit. Therefore, according to the [Gottesman–Knill theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottesman%E2%80%93Knill_theorem), this problem can be solved in polynomial time on a classical computer. So, it might look like quantum computers aren't better than classical ones in solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we apply certain restrictions on matrix $A$, the circuit will have fixed depth (i.e. number of `Moment`s). Namely, if the matrix $A$ is an adjacency matrix of a \"grid\" graph (whose edges can be colored in 4 colors), all CZ gates will fit in 4 `Moment`s, and overall we will have only 8 `Moment`s - and this doesn't depend on $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for classical circuits it can be proven (see [1]) that even if we restrict matrix $A$ in the same way, the depth of classical circuit (with gates of bounded fan-in) must grow as $n$ grows (in fact, it grows as $\\log(n)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of complexity theory, this problem is in [QNC<sup>0</sup>](https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:Q#qnc0), but not in [NC<sup>0</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_(complexity)), which shows that\n",

    "## Preparation and brute force solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For small values of $n$ we can solve this problem with a trivial brute force solution. First, we need to build $\\mathcal{L}_q$. We can do that by checking for all possible $2^n$ binary vectors, whether it belongs to $\\mathcal{L}_q$, using the definition of $\\mathcal{L}_q$. Then we need to try all possible $z \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and for each of them and for each $x \\in \\mathcal{L}_q$ check whether $q(x) = 2 z^T x$.\n",

    "Suppose we have a function $C(z)$ which we want to minimize. Here, $z$ denotes a collection of variables $z = z_1,z_2,\\ldots, z_n$, where each $z_j$ can be either $+1$ or $-1$. (The important thing here is that each $z_j$ has *two possible values*. By convention we choose those values to be $\\pm 1$). The QAOA is a general-purpose algorithm whose goal is to produce an assignment of the $z_j$ that gives a relatively low value of $C(z)$. It's not guaranteed to give the lowest possible value of $C(z)$ (hence \"approximate\" in the name) except in a particular limit which we will discuss.\n",

To be more specific, let's agree that the value of $z_j$ corresponds to the measurement outcome of the Pauli-$Z$ operator on the $j$th qubit. (There is a potential confusion here because the state $| 0 \\rangle$ corresponds to $z = +1$, while the state $| 1\\rangle$ corresponds to $z=-1$.

First, note that the function is periodic in $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ with shorter periods than one might naively expect given the definition of the gates. The details of why that's true will take us away from the main content of this tutorial, but it's a good thing to understand so that the parameter space can be efficiently truncated.\n",

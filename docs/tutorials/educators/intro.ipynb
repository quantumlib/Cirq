    "[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq) is a framework for writing quantum algorithms for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Roughly speaking, NISQ devices are those with O(100) qubits that can enact O(1000) gates.  Because the resources for NISQ devices are so constrained, we believe that a framework for writing programs on these devices needs to be aware of all of the architectural properties of the device on which the algorithm is written. This is in contrast to other frameworks where there is a clean separation between the abstract model being used and the details of the device.  \n",

    "Above we created a `Circuit` by passing in a list of operations to its constructor.  In Cirq, there are many ways to construct and modify circuits, and each of these is useful in different contexts.  Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Circuit(...)`: This is the simplest way to make a circuit. Give this method some operations, and out pops a circuit.\n",
    "2.  `append`:  `Circuit`s are mutable. You can start with an empty `circ = cirq.Circuit()` and simply `circ.append(operations)` to add on more and more operations .\n",

In this section we will show how to write circuits for the Deutsch algorithm and then as an exercise in using Cirq for algorithms for a small version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the Deutsch algorithm.  In Deutsch's algorithm you are given access to a box which computes a one bit boolean function.  That is it is a box which takes in a bit and outputs a bit.  If we want to be a mathematician or theoretical computer scientist we write the function $f$ as $f: \\{0, 1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$.  There are exactly four such boolean functions which we can write out in a table\n",

Over their inputs $0$ and $1$, they have an equal number of $0$s and $1$s in their truth table.  \n",

The easiest way to see this is just to consider what happens if you query the function on one particular input and notice that, for either input, learning the value of the function does not separate the constant from balanced functions.

    "Now lets turn to the quantum approach to this problem.  There is one bit of book keeping we need to take care of.  Above we have described a classical function on bits that is not reversible.  That is, knowing the values of the output does not allow us to determine uniquely the value of the input.  In order to run this on a quantum computer, however we need to make this computation reversible.  A trick for taking a classical non-reversible function and making it \"quantum happy\" is to compute the value in an extra register and store the input.  Suppose we have an $n$ bit input $x$ and we are computing a (potentially non-reverisble) boolean function $f(x)$.  Then we can implement this via a Unitary $U_f$ that acts like on $n + 1$ qubits\n",

Of course we could have applied the unitary directly to the state, using `cirq.unitary`.

For example here we can use this to create a circuit that is a series of small `cirq.rx` rotations and plot the probablility of measuring the state in the $|0\\rangle$ state:"

    "Supose there is a gate that you want Cirq to support, but it is not implemented in Cirq.  How do you go about adding a new gate?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cirq tries to be Pythonic.  One way in which it does this is that it relies on Python's **protocol** pattern.  Protocols are similar to interfaces, in that they define a collection of methods that an object must support to implement a protocol, but different in that this requirement is more informal and not a part of a class or interface declaration.  An object supports a protocol if it implements the methods that the protocol defines.  You're probably familiar with this if you've ever done something like defined your own `Container` in Python.  To do this for an object you simply define the `__contains__`, `__setitem__`, and `__getitem__` methods on your object, and then you can use this object anywere the Container protocol is supported.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works for defining a custom gate.  The gate we will define is a single qubit gate that has only rational amplitudes. This is based on the famous 3, 4, 5 triangle you may remember from a long ago math class: $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$.  Using this observation we can construct normalized vectors and a unitary transform using the ratios of $3$, $4$, and $5$: \n",

    "\\end{array} \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple implementation of this gate in Cirq.  To do this we simply define a class that inherits from `cirq.SingleQubitGate` and implements the `cirq.SupportsUnitary` protocol by implementing the `_unitary_(self)` method.  We also define an optional `__str__` representation which Cirq will use when printing this gate out in a circuit diagram."

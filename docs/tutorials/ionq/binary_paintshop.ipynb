    " If two consecutive cars in the sequence are painted in different colors the robots have to rinse the old color, clean the nozzles and flush in the new color. This color change procedure costs time, paint, water and ultimately costs money, which is why we want to minimize the number of color changes. However a rearrangement of the car sequence is not at our disposal (because of restrictions that are posed by the remainig manufacturing processes), but we can decide once we reach the first car of each car pair which color to paint the pair first. When we have chosen the color for the first car the other car has to be painted in the other respective color. Obvious generalizations exist, for example more than two colors and groups of cars with more than 2 cars where it is permissible to exchange colors, however for demonstration purposes it suffices to consider the here presented binary version of the paintshop problem. The binary paintshop problem is NP-hard and additionally it is NP-hard to come up with approximate solutions with an arbitrary performance guarantee. A performance guarantee in this context would be a proof that an approximation algorithm never gives us a solution with a number of color changes that is more than some factor times the optimal number of color changes. This is the situation where substantial quantum speedup can be assumed (c.f. [Quantum Computing in the NISQ era and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862)). It can also be shown that the here presented quantum algorithm can deliver on average better solutions than all polynomial runtime heuristics specificall developed for the paintshop problem in constant time (constant query complexity) (c.f. [Beating classical heuristics for the binary paint shop problem with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03403))."

    "## Spin Glass \n",
    "To be able to solve the binary paintshop problem with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) we need to translate the problem to a spin glass problem. Interestingly that is possible with no spatial overhead, i.e. the spin glass has as many spins as the sequence has car pairs. The state of every spin represents the color we paint the respective first car in the seqence of every car pair. Every second car is painted with the repsective other color. The interactions of the spin glass can be deduced proceeding through the fixed car sequence: If two cars are adjacent to each other and both of them are either the first or the second car in their respective car pairs we can add a ferromagnetic interaction to the spin glass in order to penalize the color change between these two cars. If two cars are next to each other and one of the cars is the first and the other the second in their respective car pairs we have to add a antiferromagnetic interaction to the spin glass in order to penalize the color change because in this case the color for the car that is the second car in its car pair is exactly the opposite. All color changes in the car sequence are equivalent which is why we have equal magnitude ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions and additionally we choose unit magnitude interactions."

Since the storage of the piece type is entirely classical, we will ignore it throughout the rest of this tutorial and focus on the quantum aspects of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classical chess squares have only two states.  Each square is either occupied or not.  For a quantum version of the game, we will want to allow a continuous spectrum of possibilities of the square's occupancy, as represented by a quantum bit, or qubit.\n",

        "\n",
        "For quantum chess, we would like to do an analogous operation that preserves any quantum information.  In order to do this, we will swap the two squares.  We will do this by performing an **iSWAP** gate between the two qubits that represent those squares.  Note that this operation will also add a phase of *i* onto the qubits in addition to swapping them, adding a uniquely quantum aspect to the move.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Standard Move](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/qc_standard_move.png)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Split move\n",
        "\n",
        "The split move is unique to quantum chess.  This move will be analogous to moving a piece to two different target squares simultaneously.  If we were to then measure the quantum board, we should get a 50% probability of seeing the piece in either of the two target squares.\n",
        "\n",
        "This will be accomplished by doing a $\\sqrt{\\text{iSWAP}}$ between the source and the first target.  This will create an equal superposition between the source and the first target square.  We would finish the move by performing a iSWAP between the source square and second target square.  This will create an equal superposition between the two target squares.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Split Move](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/qc_split_move1.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose that that we split move a King on 'a1' to the squares 'b1' and 'b2'.  To do this, we would do a $\\sqrt{\\text{iSWAP}}$ between the qubits representing 'a1' and 'b1' followed by an **iSWAP** on the 'a1' and 'b2' qubits.  A short-hand notation for this move is *Ks1^t1t2* for source square s1 and split targets t1 and t2.  This example would be noted as *Ka1^b1b2*.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Slide move\n",
        "\n",
        "A slide move is how we will move bishops, queens, and rooks.  These pieces move along a straight path, but cannot pass through intervening pieces.  However, in quantum chess, there may be a piece that is in superposition and may or may not block the path of this move.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to accomplish this move without measuring (and thereby destroying the quantum nature of the game), we will need to **entangle** the two pieces.  The way we will do this is called a \"controlled\" gate.  A [controlled gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Controlled_(cX_cY_cZ)_gates) is a gate that is only performed if the control qubit(s) are in the `|1>` state.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will only consider paths that are blocked by one possible piece.  In this case, we will perform a **controlled-iSWAP** between the source square and target square controlled by the square that is potentially blocking the path.\n",

        "![Slide Move](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/qc_slide_move.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose we are moving a rook from 'a1' to 'c1', but there is a split knight on 'b1'.  To perform this slide move, we would do an iSWAP between the qubits that represent 'a1' and 'c1' controlled by the 'b1' qubit.  This operation can result in two potential states.  Either the rook is on 'c1' and the knight is not on 'b1' (path was open) or, alternatively, the rook is on 'a1' and the knight is on 'b1' (path was blocked).  The quantum board state cannot be described without mentioning the relationship between the 'b1' and 'a1'/'c1' squares, so we can say that those squares are *entangled*.\n",

        "#### Exclusion move\n",
        "\n",
        "It was mentioned earlier that each square must have only one type of piece.  For instance, a square cannot have 0.1 of a knight and 0.5 of a rook.  This would not be allowed.  This is called the 'no double occupancy' rule.  We will use measurement as a tool to prevent this situation and disambiguate the type of the piece.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can happen in a variety of circumstances, but we will only consider the case where a piece attempts to make a legal, standard move into a square with a piece of its own color.  \n",
        "\n",
        "![Exclusion Move](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/qc_exclusion_move.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, suppose we attempt to move a king from 'a1' to 'a2' and there is a split knight on the 'a2' square.  We would then need to measure the 'a2' square.  If the measurement is 1, then the knight occupies the square and the king cannot move.  If the measurement is 0, the knight is not on the square and the king moves successfully.  In this case, we have a classical 'mixture' of states.  Half the time, we would get the king on 'a1' and the knight on 'a2'.  The other half of the time, the king would be on 'a2'.  However, since we have measured and projected the state to one of these possibilities, there would be no superposition or entanglement, and this part of the board would be in a classical state (definitively in either one configuration or the other).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Other moves\n",
        "\n",
        "These four type of moves are enough to illustrate the complexities of translating an abstract algorithm (quantum chess) onto a concrete hardware implementation.  However, those who are curious can see the full rule set in the [Quantum Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05836) paper on arXiv, including for capture, en passant, and castling.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise for the reader**: This describes one possible rule set for translating the game of chess into the quantum world.  How might the game change if you use SWAP gates instead of iSWAP gates?  Can you devise ways to tell the two games apart?  Can you think of other methods to create split moves or other interesting alternatives?\n"

Since we haven't figured out how we will represent this on the hardware, we will use Cirq's concept of `NamedQubit` in order to define the squares as logical qubits without defining a device topology.  This may feel unusual to some, but it can be compared to \"textbook\" circuits that have lines for abstract qubits that are unnamed or have simple symbolic names.  We will first try to define our algorithm in the abstract case, then move towards a physical representation at the end of this colab."

So, when we measure the king's position at the end of the circuit, we need to measure its new position within the 'a3' qubit.\n",

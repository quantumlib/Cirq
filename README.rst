Cirq is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

Hello Qubit
-----------

A simple example to get you up and running:

.. code-block:: python

  import cirq

  # Pick a qubit.
  qubit = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)

  # Create a circuit
  circuit = cirq.Circuit(
      cirq.X(qubit)**0.5,  # Square root of NOT.
      cirq.measure(qubit, key='m')  # Measurement.
  )
  print("Circuit:")
  print(circuit)

  # Simulate the circuit several times.
  simulator = cirq.Simulator()
  result = simulator.run(circuit, repetitions=20)
  print("Results:")
  print(result)

Example output:

.. code-block::

  Circuit:
  (0, 0): ───X^0.5───M('m')───
  Results:
  m=11000111111011001000

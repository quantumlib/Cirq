    """Linear XEB fidelity estimator.

    Estimates fidelity from ideal probabilities of observed bitstrings.

    This estimator makes two assumptions. First, it assumes that the circuit
    used in experiment is sufficiently scrambling that its output probabilities
    follow the Porter-Thomas distribution. This assumption holds for typical
    instances of random quantum circuits of sufficient depth. Second, it assumes
    that the circuit uses enough qubits so that the Porter-Thomas distribution
    can be approximated with the exponential distribution.

    In practice the validity of these assumptions can be confirmed by plotting
    a histogram of output probabilities and comparing it to the exponential
    distribution.

    The mean of this estimator is the true fidelity f and the variance is

        (1 + 2f - f^2) / M

    where f is the fidelity and M the number of observations, equal to
    len(probabilities). This is better than logarithmic XEB (see below)
    when fidelity is f < 0.32. Since this estimator is unbiased, the
    variance is equal to the mean squared error of the estimator.

    The estimator is intended for use with xeb_fidelity() below.

    Args:
        hilbert_space_dimension: Dimension of the Hilbert space on which
           the channel whose fidelity is being estimated is defined.
        probabilities: Ideal probabilities of bitstrings observed in

    Fidelity quantifies the similarity of two quantum states. Here, we estimate
    the fidelity between the theoretically predicted output state of circuit and
    the state produced in its experimental realization. Note that we don't know
    the latter state. Nevertheless, we can estimate the fidelity between the two
    states from the knowledge of the bitstrings observed in the experiment.

    In order to make the estimate more robust one should average the estimates
    over many random circuits. The API supports per-circuit fidelity estimation
    to enable users to examine the properties of estimate distribution over
    many circuits.

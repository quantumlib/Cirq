    """Generate a random quantum circuit of a particular form.

    This construction is based on the circuits used in the paper
    https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5.

    The generated circuit consists of a number of "cycles", this number being
    specified by `depth`. Each cycle is actually composed of two sub-layers:
    a layer of single-qubit gates followed by a layer of two-qubit gates,
    controlled by their respective arguments, see below. The pairs of qubits
    in a given entangling layer is controlled by the `pattern` argument,
    see below.

    Args:
        qubits: The qubits to use.
        depth: The number of cycles.
        two_qubit_op_factory: A callable that returns a two-qubit operation.
            These operations will be generated with calls of the form
            `two_qubit_op_factory(q0, q1, prng)`, where `prng` is the
            pseudorandom number generator.
        pattern: A sequence of GridInteractionLayers, each of which determine
            which pairs of qubits are entangled. The layers in a pattern are
            iterated through sequentially, repeating until `depth` is reached.
        single_qubit_gates: Single-qubit gates are selected randomly from this
            sequence. No qubit is acted upon by the same single-qubit gate in
            consecutive cycles. If only one choice of single-qubit gate is
            given, then this constraint is not enforced.
        add_final_single_qubit_layer: Whether to include a final layer of
            single-qubit gates after the last cycle.
        seed: A seed or random state to use for the pseudorandom number
            generator.

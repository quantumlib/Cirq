    This works by calling `val`'s _phase_by_ method and returning
    the result.

    Args:
        val: The value to describe with a unitary matrix.
        phase_turns: The amount to phase the gate, in fractions of a whole

        qubit_index: The index of the target qubit the phasing applies to. For
            operations this is the index of the qubit within the operation's
            qubit list. For gates it's the index of the qubit within the tuple
            of qubits taken by the gate's `on` method.
        default: The default value to return if `val` can't be phased. If not

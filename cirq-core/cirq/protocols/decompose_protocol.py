    """An object that can be decomposed into simpler operations.

    All decomposition methods should ultimately terminate on basic 1-qubit and
    2-qubit gates included by default in Cirq. If a custom decomposition is not
    specified, Cirq will decompose all operations to XPow/YPow/ZPow/CZPow/Measurement
    + Global phase gateset. However, the default decomposition in Cirq should be a last resort
    fallback and it is recommended for consumers of decomposition to either not depend
    upon a specific target gateset, or give an `intercepting_decomposer` to `cirq.decompose`
    that attempts to target a specific gate set.

    For example, `cirq.TOFFOLI` has a `_decompose_` method that returns a pair
    of Hadamard gates surrounding a `cirq.CCZ`. Although `cirq.CCZ` is not a
    1-qubit or 2-qubit operation, it specifies its own `_decompose_` method
    that only returns 1-qubit or 2-qubit operations. This means that iteratively
    decomposing `cirq.TOFFOLI` terminates in 1-qubit and 2-qubit operations, and
    so almost all decomposition-aware code will be able to handle `cirq.TOFFOLI`
    instances.

    Callers are responsible for iteratively decomposing until they are given
    operations that they understand. The `cirq.decompose` method is a simple way
    to do this, because it has logic to recursively decompose until a given
    `keep` predicate is satisfied.

    Code implementing `_decompose_` MUST NOT create cycles, such as a gate A
    decomposes into a gate B which decomposes back into gate A. This will result
    in infinite loops when calling `cirq.decompose`.

    It is permitted (though not recommended) for the chain of decompositions
    resulting from an operation to hit a dead end before reaching 1-qubit or
    2-qubit operations. When this happens, `cirq.decompose` will raise
    a `TypeError` by default, but can be configured to ignore the issue or
    raise a caller-provided error.

    Returning `NotImplemented` or `None` means "not decomposable". Otherwise an

    For example, a SWAP gate can be turned into three CNOTs. But in order to
    describe those CNOTs one must be able to talk about "the target qubit" and
    "the control qubit". This can only be done once the qubits-to-be-swapped are
    known.

    The main user of this protocol is `GateOperation`, which decomposes itself
    by delegating to its gate. The qubits argument is needed because gates are
    specified independently of target qubits and so must be told the relevant
    qubits. A `GateOperation` implements `SupportsDecompose` as long as its gate

        This method is used by the global `cirq.unitary` method. If this method
        is not present, or returns NotImplemented, it is assumed that the
        receiving object doesn't have a unitary matrix (resulting in a TypeError
        or default result when calling `cirq.unitary` on it). (The ability to
        return NotImplemented is useful when a class cannot know if it has a
        matrix until runtime, e.g. cirq.X**c normally has a matrix but
        cirq.X**sympy.Symbol('a') doesn't.)

        The order of cells in the matrix is always implicit with respect to the
        object being called. For example, for gates the matrix must be ordered
        with respect to the list of qubits that the gate is applied to. For
        operations, the matrix is ordered to match the list returned by its
        `qubits` attribute. The qubit-to-amplitude order mapping matches the
        ordering of numpy.kron(A, B), where A is a qubit earlier in the list
        than the qubit B.

        Returns:
            A unitary matrix describing this value, or NotImplemented if there
            is no such matrix.

    The matrix is determined by any one of the following techniques:

    - The value has a `_unitary_` method that returns something besides None or

    - The value has a `_decompose_` method that returns a list of operations,

        created by aggregating the sub-operations' unitary effects.
    - The value has an `_apply_unitary_` method, and it returns something

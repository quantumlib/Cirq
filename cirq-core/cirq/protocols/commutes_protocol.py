        Can return None to indicate the commutation relationship is
        indeterminate (e.g. incompatible matrix sizes). Can return
        NotImplemented to indicate to the caller that they should try some other
        way of determining the commutation relationship.

        Args:
            other: The other object that may or may not commute with the
                receiving object.
            atol: Absolute error tolerance. Some objects that commute may appear
                to not quite commute, due to rounding error from floating point
                computations. This parameter indicates an acceptable level of
                deviation from exact commutativity. The exact meaning of what
                error is being tolerated is not specified. It could be the
                maximum angle between rotation axes in the Bloch sphere, or the
                maximum trace of the absolute value of the commutator, or
                some other value convenient to the implementor of the method.

        Returns:
            Whether or not the values commute.

            True: `self` commutes with `other` within absolute tolerance `atol`.

            False: `self` does not commute with `other`.

            None: There is not a well defined commutation result. For example,
            whether or not parameterized operations will commute may depend
            on the parameter values and so is indeterminate.

            NotImplemented: Unable to determine anything about commutativity.
            Consider falling back to other strategies, such as asking
            `other` if it commutes with `self` or computing the unitary
            matrices of both values.

    This is determined by any one of the following techniques:

    - Either value has a `_commutes_` method that returns 'True', 'False', or
        'None' (meaning indeterminate). If both methods either don't exist or
        return `NotImplemented` then another strategy is tried. `v1._commutes_`
        is tried before `v2._commutes_`.
    - Both values are matrices. The return value is determined by checking if
        v1 @ v2 - v2 @ v1 is sufficiently close to zero.
    - Both values are `cirq.Operation` instances. If the operations apply to
        disjoint qubit sets then they commute. Otherwise, if they have unitary
        matrices, those matrices are checked for commutativity (while accounting
        for the fact that the operations may have different qubit orders or only
        partially overlap).

    If none of these techniques succeeds, the commutativity is assumed to be
    indeterminate.

    Args:
        v1: One of the values to check for commutativity. Can be a cirq object
            such as an operation, or a numpy matrix.
        v2: The other value to check for commutativity. Can be a cirq object
            such as an operation, or a numpy matrix.
        default: A fallback value to return, instead of raising a ValueError, if
            it is indeterminate whether or not the two values commute.
        atol: Absolute error tolerance. If all entries in v1@v2 - v2@v1 have a
            magnitude less than this tolerance, v1 and v2 can be reported as
            commuting. Defaults to 1e-8.

    Returns:
        True: `v1` and `v2` commute (or approximately commute).
        False: `v1` and `v2` don't commute.
        default: The commutativity of `v1` and `v2` is indeterminate, or could
        not be determined, and the `default` argument was specified.

    Raises:
        TypeError: The commutativity of `v1` and `v2` is indeterminate, or could

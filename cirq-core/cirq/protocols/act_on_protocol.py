    For example, the action may be a `cirq.Operation` and the state argument may
    represent the internal state of a state vector simulator (a
    `cirq.StateVectorSimulationState`).

    For non-operations, the `qubits` argument must be explicitly supplied.

    The action is applied by first checking if `action._act_on_` exists and
    returns `True` (instead of `NotImplemented`) for the given object. Then
    fallback strategies specified by the state argument via `_act_on_fallback_`
    are attempted. If those also fail, the method fails with a `TypeError`.

        action: The operation, gate, or other to apply to the state tensor.
        sim_state: A mutable state object that should be modified by the
            action. May specify an `_act_on_fallback_` method to use in case
            the action doesn't recognize it.
        qubits: The sequence of qubits to use when applying the action.

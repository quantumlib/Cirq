    A. Try to use `val._apply_mixture_(args)`.

            go to step B.
        2. If '_apply_mixture_' is present and returns None conclude that

        3. If '_apply_mixture_' is present and returns a numpy array conclude
            that the mixture was applied successfully and forward result to
            caller.

    B. Construct an ApplyUnitaryArgs object `uargs` from `args` and then
        try to use `cirq.apply_unitary(val, uargs, None)`.
        1. If `None` is returned then go to step C.
        2. If a numpy array is returned forward this result back to the caller
            and return.

    C. Try to use `val._mixture_()`.
        1. If '_mixture_' is not present or returns NotImplemented
            go to step D.
        2. If '_mixture_' is present and returns None conclude that `val` has
            no effect and return.
        3. If '_mixture_' returns a list of tuples, loop over the list and
            examine each tuple. If the tuple is of the form
            `(probability, np.ndarray)` use matrix multiplication to apply it.
            If the tuple is of the form `(probability, op)` where op is any op,
            attempt to use `cirq.apply_unitary(op, uargs, None)`. If this

        args: A mutable `cirq.ApplyMixtureArgs` object describing the target
            tensor, available workspace, and left and right axes to operate on.
            The attributes of this object will be mutated as part of computing
            the result.
        default: What should be returned if `val` doesn't have a mixture. If
            not specified, a TypeError is raised instead of returning a default
            value.

    Returns:
        If the receiving object is not able to apply a mixture,
        the specified default value is returned (or a TypeError is raised). If
        this occurs, then `target_tensor` should not have been mutated.

        If the receiving object was able to work inline, directly
        mutating `target_tensor` it will return `target_tensor`. The caller is
        responsible for checking if the result is `target_tensor`.

        If the receiving object wrote its output over `out_buffer`, the
        result will be `out_buffer`. The caller is responsible for
        checking if the result is `out_buffer` (and e.g. swapping
        the buffer for the target tensor before the next call).

        Note that it is an error for the return object to be either of the
        auxiliary buffers, and the method will raise an AssertionError if
        this contract is violated.

        The receiving object may also write its output over a new buffer
        that it created, in which case that new array is returned.

    Raises:
        TypeError: `val` doesn't have a mixture and `default` wasn't specified.
        ValueError: Different left and right shapes of `args.target_tensor`
            selected by `left_axes` and `right_axes` or `qid_shape(val)` doesn't

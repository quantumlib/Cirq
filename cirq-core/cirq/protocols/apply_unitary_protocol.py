class ApplyUnitaryArgs:
    """Arguments for performing an efficient left-multiplication by a unitary.

    The receiving object is expected to mutate `target_tensor` so that it
    contains the state after multiplication, and then return `target_tensor`.
    Alternatively, if workspace is required, the receiving object can overwrite
    `available_buffer` with the results and return `available_buffer`. Or, if
    the receiving object is attempting to be simple instead of fast, it can
    create an entirely new array and return that.

    Attributes:
        target_tensor: The input tensor that needs to be left-multiplied by
            the unitary effect of the receiving object. The tensor will
            have the shape (2, 2, 2, ..., 2). It usually corresponds to
            a multi-qubit superposition, but it could also be a multi-qubit
            unitary transformation or some other concept.
        available_buffer: Pre-allocated workspace with the same shape and
            dtype as the target tensor.
        axes: Which axes the unitary effect is being applied to (e.g. the
            qubits that the gate is operating on).
        subspaces: Which subspace (in the computational basis) the unitary
            effect is being applied to, on each axis. By default it applies
            to subspace 0..d-1 on each axis, where d is the dimension of the
            unitary effect on that axis. Subspaces on each axis must be
            representable as a slice, so the dimensions specified here need to
            have a consistent step size.

        Returns:

    Uses `cirq.apply_unitary` on each of the unitary values, to apply them to
    the state tensor from the `args` argument.

    CAUTION: if one of the given unitary values does not have a unitary effect,
    forcing the method to terminate, the method will not rollback changes
    from previous unitary values.

    Args:
        unitary_values: The values with unitary effects to apply to the target.
        qubits: The qubits that will be targeted by the unitary values. These
            qubits match up, index by index, with the `indices` property of the
            `args` argument.
        args: A mutable `cirq.ApplyUnitaryArgs` object describing the target
            tensor, available workspace, and axes to operate on. The attributes
            of this object will be mutated as part of computing the result. If
            not specified, this defaults to the zero state of the given qubits
            with an axis ordering matching the given qubit ordering.
        default: What should be returned if any of the unitary values actually
            don't have a unitary effect. If not specified, a TypeError is
            raised instead of returning a default value.

    Returns:
        If any of the unitary values do not have a unitary effect, the
        specified default value is returned (or a TypeError is raised).
        CAUTION: If this occurs, the contents of `args.target_tensor`
        and `args.available_buffer` may have been mutated.

        If all of the unitary values had a unitary effect that was
        successfully applied, this method returns the `np.ndarray`
        storing the final result. This `np.ndarray` may be
        `args.target_tensor`, `args.available_buffer`, or some
        other instance. The caller is responsible for dealing with
        this potential aliasing of the inputs and the result.

        TypeError: An item from `unitary_values` doesn't have a unitary effect
            and `default` wasn't specified.

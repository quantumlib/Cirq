            Inconclusive.

            Unitary.
        Case c) Method returns `False`.
            Not unitary.

    2. Try to use `val._decompose_()`.
        Case a) Method not present or returns `NotImplemented` or `None`.
            Inconclusive.
        Case b) Method returns an OP_TREE containing only unitary operations.
            Unitary.
        Case c) Method returns an OP_TREE containing non-unitary operations.
            Not Unitary.

        Case a) Method not present or returns `NotImplemented`.
            Inconclusive.
        Case b) Method returns a numpy array.
            Unitary.
        Case c) Method returns `None`.

    4. Try to use `val._unitary_()`.
        Case a) Method not present or returns `NotImplemented`.
            Continue to next strategy.
        Case b) Method returns a numpy array.
            Unitary.
        Case c) Method returns `None`.
            Not unitary.

    result, that these results will all be consistent with each other. If all
    strategies are inconclusive, the value is classified as non-unitary.

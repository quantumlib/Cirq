    Measurement keys are used in referencing the results of a measurement.

    Users are free to implement one of the following. Do not implement multiple
    of these returning different values. The protocol behavior will be
    unexpected in such a case.
    1. `_measurement_key_objs_` returning an iterable of `MeasurementKey`s
    2. `_measurement_key_obj_` returning one `MeasurementKey`
    3. `_measurement_key_names_` returning an iterable of strings
    4. `_measurement_key_name_` returning one string

    Note: Measurements, in contrast to general quantum channels, are
    distinguished by the recording of the quantum operation that occurred.
    That is a general quantum channel may enact the evolution
        $$
        \rho \rightarrow \sum_k A_k \rho A_k^\dagger
        $$
    where as a measurement enacts the evolution
        $$
        \rho \rightarrow A_k \rho A_k^\dagger

    conditional on the measurement outcome being $k$.

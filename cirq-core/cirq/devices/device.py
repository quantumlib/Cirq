    """Hardware constraints for validating circuits.

    This class is an interface for representing constraints and
    structures of quantum hardware devices.

    This interface is split into two parts: validation and
    exploration.  The primary responsibility of this class
    is to validate circuits (ie. can this device execute the
    circuit as-is?).  The secondary responsibility of the class
    is to provide additional information about the device
    such as the qubits on the device and their connectivity.
    These 'exploratory' attributes are all contained within
    the `metadata` attribute.

    Implementors of this class should, at minimum, define
    the `validate_operation` method.  If the device has more
    global constraints (such as not allowing adjacent operations
    or having a maximum depth), then `validate_moment` and
    `validate_circuit` can also be defined.  If not specified,
    these methods default to calling `validate_operation` on each
    operation in each moment.

    Optionally, implementors may implement a `metadata` function
    that contains information about the device.  It is recommended
    (but not required) to specify the qubits and connectivity
    using a `cirq.DeviceMetadata` object.   This class can also be
    sub-classed to give more detailed information, such as gate
    durations, gate sets, compilation targets,
    vendor-specific information, and other attributes.

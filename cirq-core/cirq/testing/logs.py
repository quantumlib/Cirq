    """A context manager for testing logging and warning events.

    To use this one wraps the code that is to be tested for log events within
    the context of this method's return value:

        with assert_logs(count=2, 'first_match', 'second_match') as logs:
            <code that produces python logs>

    This captures the logging that occurs in the context of the with statement,
    asserts that the number of logs is equal to `count`, and then asserts that
    all of the strings in `matches` appear in the messages of the logs.
    Further, the captured logs are accessible as `logs` and further testing
    can be done beyond these simple asserts.

    Args:
        *matches: Each of these is checked to see if they match, as a substring,
            any of the captures log messages.
        count: The expected number of messages in logs. Defaults to 1. If None is passed in counts
            are not checked.
        min_level: The minimum level at which to capture the logs. See the python logging
            module for valid levels. By default this captures at the
            `logging.WARNING` level and above, so this does not capture `logging.INFO`
            or `logging.DEBUG` logs by default.
        max_level: The maximum level at which to capture the logs. See the python logging
            module for valid levels. By default this captures to the `logging.CRITICAL` level
            thus, all the errors and critical messages will be captured as well.
        capture_warnings: Whether warnings from the python's `warnings` module
            are redirected to the logging system and captured.

    Returns:
        A ContextManager that can be entered into which captures the logs
        for code executed within the entered context. This ContextManager
        checks that the asserts for the logs are true on exit.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `min_level` is greater than `max_level`.

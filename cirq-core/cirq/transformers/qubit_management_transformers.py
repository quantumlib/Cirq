    """Uses `qm: QubitManager` to map all `CleanQubit`/`BorrowableQubit`s to system qubits.

    `CleanQubit` and `BorrowableQubit` are internal qubit types that are used as placeholder qubits
    to record a clean / dirty ancilla allocation request.

    This transformer uses the `QubitManager` provided in the input to:
     - Allocate clean ancilla qubits by delegating to `qm.qalloc` for all `CleanQubit`s.
     - Allocate dirty qubits for all `BorrowableQubit` types via the following two steps:
         1. First analyse the input circuit and check if there are any suitable system qubits
            that can be borrowed, i.e. ones which do not have any overlapping operations
            between circuit[start_index : end_index] where `(start_index, end_index)` is the
            lifespan of temporary borrowable qubit under consideration. If yes, borrow the system
            qubits to replace the temporary `BorrowableQubit`.
         2. If no system qubits can be borrowed, delegate the request to `qm.qborrow`.

    Notes:
        1. The borrow protocol can be made more efficient by also considering the newly
    allocated clean ancilla qubits in step-1 before delegating to `qm.borrow`, but this
    optimization is left as a future improvement.
        2. As of now, the transformer does not preserve moment structure and defaults to
    inserting all mapped operations in a resulting circuit using EARLIEST strategy. The reason
    is that preserving moment structure forces additional constraints on the qubit allocation
    strategy (i.e. if two operations `op1` and `op2` are in the same moment, then we cannot
    reuse ancilla across `op1` and `op2`). We leave it up to the user to force such constraints
    using the qubit manager instead of making it part of the transformer.
        3. However, for borrowable system qubits managed by the transformer, we do not reuse qubits
    within the same moment.
        4. Since this is not implemented using the cirq transformers infrastructure, we currently
    do not support recursive mapping within sub-circuits and that is left as a future TODO.

    Args:
        circuit: Input `cirq.Circuit` containing temporarily allocated
            `CleanQubit`/`BorrowableQubit`s.
        qm: An instance of `cirq.QubitManager` specifying the strategy to use for allocating /
            / deallocating new ancilla qubits to replace the temporary qubits.

    Returns:
        An updated `cirq.Circuit` with all `CleanQubit`/`BorrowableQubit` mapped to either existing
        system qubits or new ancilla qubits allocated using the `qm` qubit manager.

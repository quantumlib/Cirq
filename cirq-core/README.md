# cirq-core

[Cirq] is a Python package for writing, manipulating, and running [quantum
circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit) on quantum computers
and simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with todayâ€™s
[noisy intermediate-scale quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862) (NISQ)
computers, where the details of quantum hardware are vital to achieving
state-of-the-art results. For more information about Cirq, please visit the
[Cirq documentation site].

This Python module is `cirq-core`, which contains all the code you need to
write quantum algorithms for NISQ devices and run them on the built-in Cirq
simulators.

To run algorithms on a given quantum computing platform, you will also need to
install an appropriate Cirq hardware interface module. Please visit the
[hardware section of the Cirq documentation
site](https://quantumai.google/cirq/hardware) for information about the
hardware interface modules currently available.

## Installation

There are two installation options for the `cirq-core` module:

*   To install the stable version of `cirq-core`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-core
    ```

*   To install the latest pre-release version of `cirq-core`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-core~=1.0.dev
    ```

    (The `~=` has a special meaning to `pip` of selecting the latest version
    compatible with the `1.*` and `dev` in the name. Despite appearances,
    this will not install an old version 1.0 release!)

If you would like to install Cirq with all the optional modules, not just
`cirq-core`, then instead of the above commands, use `pip install cirq` for the
stable release or `pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the latest pre-release
version.

## Documentation

To get started with using Cirq, please refer to the [Cirq documentation site].

    This rewrites a notebook of a given path, by looking for a file corresponding to the given

    The contents of this `.tst` file are then used as replacements

        * Lines in this file without `->` are ignored.

        * Lines in this file with `->` are split into two (if there are multiple `->` it is an
        error). The first of these is compiled into a pattern match, via `re.compile`, and
        the second is the replacement for that match.

    These replacements are then applied to the notebook_path and written to a new temporary
    file.

    All replacements must be used (this is enforced as it is easy to write a replacement rule
    which does not match).

    It is the responsibility of the caller of this method to delete the new file.

    Returns:
        The absolute path to the rewritten file in temporary directory.
        If no `.tst` file exists the new file is a copy of the input notebook.

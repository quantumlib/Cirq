# ========================== ISOLATED NOTEBOOK TESTS ============================================
#
# It is assumed that notebooks install cirq conditionally if they can't import cirq. This
# installation path is the main focus and it is exercised in an isolated virtual environment for
# each notebook. This is also the path that is tested in the devsite workflows, these tests meant
# to provide earlier feedback.
#
# In case the dev environment changes or this particular file changes, all notebooks are executed!
# This can take a long time and even lead to timeout on Github Actions, hence partitioning of the
# tests is possible, via setting the NOTEBOOK_PARTITIONS env var to e.g. 5, and then passing to
# pytest the `-k partition-0` or `-k partition-1`, etc. argument to limit to the given partition.

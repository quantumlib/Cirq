# This script prints a new dev version id if the current cirq version
# is a dev release.
#
# If version in Cirq's _version.py file contains 'dev' this
# prints a dev version appended by an id given by the time the
# script was run. This can be used to ensure later releases
# have increasing numerical release numbers.
#
# This script is used by publish-dev-package and can also be
# used to set a bash variable for use by travis ci to deploy
# a new dev version on successful merge.
#
# Example:
#     > echo `generate-dev-version-id.sh`
#     0.6.0.dev20190829135619

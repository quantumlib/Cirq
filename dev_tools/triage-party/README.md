# Cirq Triage Party

See the [triaging process](../../docs/dev/triage.md).

## Configuration

For the dashboard you will have to edit the embedded YAML config in
[configmap.yaml](kubernetes/02_deployment/configmap.yaml). Please refer to the
[triage party
docs](https://github.com/google/triage-party/blob/main/docs/config.md) for
configuration details.

## Secret

Triage party needs a Github token. This is a one-time setup (per cluster
creation):

```shell
kubectl create secret generic triage-party-github-token -n triage-party --from-file=token=$HOME/.github-token
```

where `$HOME/.github-token` is a file containing the token.

## Cloud Build based deployment

On every push to main Triage Party is redeployed as defined by
[cloudbuild-deploy.yaml](cloudbuild-deploy.yaml).

## Deploying Triage Party manually

See [the cirq-infra documentation](../cirq-infra/README.md) for the required
tools.

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cirq-infra --zone us-central1-a
skaffold run --force -f=dev_tools/triage-party/skaffold.yaml
```

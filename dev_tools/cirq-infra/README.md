# Cirq infra

This doc describes cirq-infra, the GCP project supporting our open source
project. The following things are planned to be running on GCP:

*   [X] Cirq bot / PR monitor - see [../pr_monitor](../pr_monitor/README.md)
*   [X] Triage party for triaging
*   [ ] Performance tests and reports

Access is granted to Cirq maintainers only.

## GCP Configuration

### Requirements

The tools below are required to manage our infra:

*   Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart
*   kubectl: `gcloud components install kubectl`.
*   skaffold: `gcloud components install skaffold`.

### GKE Cluster

We have a 3 node GKE cluster called cirq-infra. To connect to it using kubectl
use:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cirq-infra --zone us-central1-a --project cirq-infra
```

Note that we have Workload Identity setup so that in order to access Cloud APIs
from workloads, you'll have to add permissions to the
gke-service-account@cirq-infra.iam.gserviceaccount.com service account.
Currently, it is able to access Secrets, and no other APIs.

### Secret manager

It is important to know that the Github API key in case of the Kubernetes
deployment is stored in the Cloud Secret Manager under `cirq-bot-api-key`.

# cirq-ionq

This is the Cirq-IonQ integration module. It provides an interface that allows
[Cirq] quantum algorithms to run on quantum computers made by [IonQ
Inc.](https://ionq.com/). (See the [Documentation](#documentation) section
below for information about getting access to IonQ devices.)

[Cirq] is a Python package for writing, manipulating, and running [quantum
circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit) on quantum computers
and simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with todayâ€™s
[noisy intermediate-scale quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862) (NISQ)
computers, where the details of quantum hardware are vital to achieving
state-of-the-art results. For more information about Cirq, please visit the
[Cirq documentation site].

## Installation

This module is built on top of [Cirq]; installing this module will
automatically install the `cirq-core` module and other dependencies. There are
two installation options for the `cirq-ionq` module:

*   To install the stable version of `cirq-ionq`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-ionq
    ```

*   To install the latest pre-release version of `cirq-ionq`, use

    ```shell
    pip install cirq-ionq~=1.0.dev
    ```

    (The `~=` has a special meaning to `pip` of selecting the latest version
    compatible with the `1.*` and `dev` in the name. Despite appearances,
    this will not install an old version 1.0 release!)

If you would like to install Cirq with all the optional modules, not just
`cirq-ionq`, then instead of the above commands, use `pip install cirq` for the
stable release or `pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the latest pre-release
version.

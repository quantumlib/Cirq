`Cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`__ is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

This module is **cirq-ionq**, which provides everything you'll need to run Cirq quantum algorithms on IonQ quantum computers.

Documentation
-------------

To get started with IonQ quantum computing services, checkout the following guide and tutorial:

- `Access and authentication <https://quantumai.google/cirq/ionq/access>`__
- `Getting started guide <https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials/ionq/getting_started>`__

Installation
------------

To install the stable version of only **cirq-ionq**, use `pip install cirq-ionq`.
To install the pre-release version of only **cirq-ionq**, use `pip install cirq-ionq~=1.0.dev`.

Note, that this will install both **cirq-ionq** and **cirq-core**.

To get all the optional modules installed, you'll have to use `pip install cirq` or `pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the pre-release version.

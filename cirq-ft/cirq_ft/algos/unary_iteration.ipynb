The next control checks if the previous condition was met and likewise the second selection index is also off. At this point if both these conditions are met we must be indexing 0 as the first two qubits are set to off (00), otherwise we know that we want to apply X to qubit 1 so we perform a CNOT operation to flip the bit value in the second ancilla qubit, before returning back up the circuit. Now if the left half of the circuit was not applied (i.e. the first selection register was set to 1) then the CNOT between the control qubit and the first ancilla qubit causes the ancilla qubit to toggle on. This triggers the right side of the circuit, which now performs the previously described operations to figure out if the lowest bit is set.

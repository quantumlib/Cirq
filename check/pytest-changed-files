# Runs pytest on files that have been modified.
#
# Usage:
#     check/pytest-changed-files COMPARISON_BRANCH_OR_COMMIT_ID [--pytest-flags]
#
# This tool is not clever; it does not understand dependencies between all
# files. If "x.py" or "x_test.py" have been modified, it will include
# "x_test.py" in the arguments given to pytest. That's all it does.
#
# You must specify a git commit or branch to compare against (i.e. to use when
# determining whether or not a file is considered to have "changed"). For
# example, you can compare against 'origin/master' or 'HEAD~1'.
#
# You can pass flags such as "-v" into pytest by placing them after the
# comparison id.

# Runs pytest on files that have been modified.
#
# Usage:
#     check/pytest-changed-files [BASE_REVISION] [--pytest-flags]
#
# This tool is not clever; it does not understand dependencies between all
# files. If "x.py" or "x_test.py" have been modified, it will include
# "x_test.py" in the arguments given to pytest. That's all it does.
#
# You can specify a base git revision to compare against (i.e. to use when
# determining whether or not a file is considered to have "changed"). For
# example, you can compare against 'origin/master' or 'HEAD~1'.
#
# If you don't specify a base revision, the following defaults will be tried, in
# order, until one exists:
#
#     1. upstream/master
#     2. origin/master
#     3. master
#
# If none exists, the script fails.
#
# You can pass flags such as "-v" into pytest by placing them after the
# comparison id.

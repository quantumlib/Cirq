# Cirq Performance Benchmarks
Performance benchmarking Cirq with [Airspeed Velocity](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## Overview
The benchmark files (`bench_*.py`) stored in the current package (`benchmarks/*`) are used by asv to run benchmark tests for Cirq. For more information on how to write new benchmarks, please refer [Writing benchmarks guide by ASV](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writing_benchmarks.html)

## Usage
To run all benchmarks, navigate to the root Cirq directory at the command line and execute

```bash
./check/asv_run
```

You can also pass arguments to the script, which would be forwarded to the `asv run` command. For eg:
```bash
./check/asv_run --quick --bench bench_examples --python 3.10
```

Please refer [Running Benchmarks guide by ASV](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#running-benchmarks) for more information. 

## Results Database
TODO([#3838](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/issues/3838)): Add details regarding GCP setup.

# cbrgm/pr-size-labeler-action can assign labels based on both "size" (= lines
# added + lines deleted) and number of files changed. Our current config only
# uses size (achieved by setting all files threshold to 1). The labeler decides
# on labels as follows. It calculates the size of the PR; let's call this value
# "S". It then looks sequentially through the label_config entries until it
# finds one where S <= config.size. So, e.g., "M" implies 250 < S <= 1000.

label_configs:
  - size: xs
    diff: 10           # Threshold for total LoC changed (additions + deletions)
    files: 1           # Threshold for total number of files changed
    labels: ["size: XS"]  # Labels to be applied for this size

  - size: s
    diff: 50
    files: 1
    labels: ["size: S"]

  - size: m
    diff: 250
    files: 1
    labels: ["size: M"]

  - size: l
    diff: 1000
    files: 1
    labels: ["size: L"]

  - size: xl
    diff: 5000
    files: 1
    labels: ["size: XL"]

  - size: xxl

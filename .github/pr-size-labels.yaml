# cbrgm/pr-size-labeler-action labels based on both "size" (= lines added +
# lines deleted) and number of files changed in a PR. The action looks for the
# largest matching configuration, using number of files changed first. Trying
# to think about the implications of values on two dimensions is difficult, so
# for simplicity, the settings below use the same value for both. This lets us
# think in terms of "changes" more broadly, regardless of what kind.
label_configs:
  - size: xs
    diff: 10           # Threshold for total LoC changed (additions + deletions)
    files: 10          # Threshold for total number of files changed
    labels: ["size: XS"]  # Label(s) to be applied for this size

  - size: s
    diff: 50
    files: 50
    labels: ["size: S"]

  - size: m
    diff: 250
    files: 250
    labels: ["size: M"]

  - size: l
    diff: 1000
    files: 1000
    labels: ["size: L"]

  # Although it's not obvious from the docs of the action, it uses the final
  # config for all cases that exceed the given values too. I.e., anything that
  # hits 1001 or more will be lumped together as xl.
  - size: xl
    diff: 1001
    files: 1001
    labels: ["size: XL"]

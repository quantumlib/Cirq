# cbrgm/pr-size-labeler-action can assign labels based on both "size" (= lines
# added + lines deleted) and number of files changed.

label_configs:
  - size: xs
    diff: 10           # Threshold for total LoC changed (additions + deletions)
    files: 10          # Threshold for total number of files changed
    labels: ["size: XS"]  # Labels to be applied for this size

  - size: s
    diff: 50
    files: 50
    labels: ["size: S"]

  - size: m
    diff: 250
    files: 250
    labels: ["size: M"]

  - size: l
    diff: 1000
    files: 1000
    labels: ["size: L"]

  # Although it's not obvious from the docs of the action, the way it handles
  # the final entry in the configs is it uses it for all cases that exceed the
  # given value too. I.e., anything that exceeds this is lumped together as xl.
  - size: xl
    diff: 1001
    files: 1001
    labels: ["size: XL"]

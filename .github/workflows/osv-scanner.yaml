name: OSV scan
run-name: Run open-source vulnerabilities (OSV) scanner

# The OSV scanner is a dependency vulnerability scanner that identifies known
# vulnerabilities in a project's dependencies. It supports C/C++, Python, Java,
# JavaScript, and others. The findings are reported in the repo's code-scanning
# results page, https://github.com/quantumlib/REPO/security/code-scanning/.
# For more OSV scanner examples and options, including how to ignore specific
# vulnerabilities, see https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/github-action/.

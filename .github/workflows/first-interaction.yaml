            Hello and welcome, ${{github.actor}} ðŸ‘‹!

            Thanks for filing your first issue with the ${{github.repository}}
            project! We are glad you are here and are excited to see your first
            contribution. Please keep in mind our [community participation
            guidelines](${{env.files}}/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

            If this is a bug report, we will probably need the following
            details in order to diagnose the issue. If you did not include it
            in the original issue description, please consider providing it
            now because it will probably save everyone time in the long run:

            - [ ] Environment you are using (MacOS, Windows, Colab, etc.)
            - [ ] Version of Python you are using
            - [ ] Steps to reproduce the issue

            Please allow time for the project community to be able to read the
            issue and act on it. In the meantime, you may want to look through
            the [existing open issues](${{env.repo}}/issues) to see if any look
            similar to yours. If you find a similar or identical issue,
            consider closing this one; if you don't want to close this one, it
            would be helpful if you could write a comment here that references
            the related issue and explains how this new one differs from the
            other one.

# Summary: workflow for OSSF Scorecard (https://github.com/ossf/scorecard).
#
# Scorecard is an automated tool that assesses a number of important heuristics
# associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0-10. The
# use of Scorecard is suggested in Google's internal GitHub guidance
# (go/github-docs).
#
# Scorecard creates a report page at the following URL (for a repo ORG/REPO):
# https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/ORG/REPO

# Reporting security issues

The Cirq developers and community take security bugs in Cirq seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make
every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please **do not** use GitHub issues to report security vulnerabilities; GitHub
issues are public, and doing so could allow someone to exploit the information
before the problem can be addressed. Instead, please use the GitHub ["Report
a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq/security/advisories/new)
interface from the _Security_ tab of the Cirq repository.

Please security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module rather than the Cirq project stewards, unless you believe that some
action needs to be taken with Cirq in order to guard against the effects of a
security vulnerability in a third-party module.

## Responses to security reports

The project stewards at Google Quantum AI will send a response indicating the
next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the
project stewards will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Additional points of contact

Please contact the project stewards at Google Quantum AI via email at
quantum-oss-maintainers@google.com if you have questions or other concerns. If
for any reason you are uncomfortable reaching out to the project stewards,
please email opensource@google.com.

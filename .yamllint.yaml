  line-length:
    # YAML files (especially GitHub Actions workflows) tend to end up with
    # long lines. The default of 80 is pretty limiting, and besides, in Python
    # code linting, we set line lengths to 100. May as well follow suit here.
    max: 100
    # Another common occurrence in YAML files is long URLs. The next two
    # settings are not specific to URLs, but help. It saves developer time by
    # not requiring comment directives to disable warnings at every occurrence.

# EditorConfig is a file format for specifying some common style parameters.
# Many IDEs & editors read .editorconfig files, either natively or via plugins.
# We mostly follow Google's style guides (https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
# with only a few deviations for line length and indentation in some files.
